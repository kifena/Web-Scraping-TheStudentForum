Now, you may (or may not) have seen me in these forums. Just for a bit of context, I'm an 18 year old male, who is passionate about fitness (alongside other things). Now, when it comes to fitness (in particular on TSR) I see posts, relatively often, which make no sense, or have logic which is flawed and idiotic. Now, by no means am I an 'expert' in fitness (nor do I claim to be) but, I have more knowledge than the 'average' person, and I bring forward helpful and logical advice which is beneficial for people to see. Often, people see fitness as a 'complicated' thing, not 'advanced' per se, but more 'complicated' than it needs to be. It's all really quite simple, that is when you understand the 'basics' and are aware of 'tips and tricks' which makes your fitness journey easier. Now, I'll be exploring a key element of fitness - weight loss (there's more elements, such as weight gain etc., but my main focus now is on weight loss).\\n\\nWhat is weight loss?\\n\\nSpoiler: Show \\n\\nWeight loss, quite simply, is the process of losing weight.\\n\\nWhy do people lose weight?\\n\\nSpoiler: Show \\n\\nPeople may want to lose weight because:\\nThey want to be 'healthier'.\\nThey want to be 'leaner'.\\nThey aren't satisfied with their current body.\\nBut, the main reasons vary from person to person. Keep in mind, there are more reasons, but I'm not going to write them all out; it will be too long lol.\\n\\nHow long does weight loss take?\\n\\nSpoiler: Show \\n\\nThe truth is that weight loss takes time, and it doesn't happen overnight. Most people, starting a diet, expect weight loss to happen within a couple of weeks. The fitness industry in general, is flawed. They set out false expectations and realities which gullible people follow, and when it doesn't work for them, they give up. Yes, you can lose weight extremely quickly. Then why don't you? Well, I'll explain it now. Losing weight quickly is more detrimental than beneficial. Rapid weight loss can include a bunch of health problems, such as:\\nGallstones, Dehydration, Malnutrition, Electrolyte imbalances, Headaches, Fatigue, Dizziness, Hair loss and Muscle loss, the list goes on. Why on Earth would you want to have them problems? Most people, don't consider this when they are going on 'fad' diets or 'starving' themselves. I'll provide an example now between 2 people, with one having a realistic approach and the other not. Let's say, for example, two men are both 90kg at 5 foot 10, and they want to go down to 78kg. Man 1, adopts a realistic approach. Man 2, on the other hand goes on a 'fad' diet they found online. For Man 1, a healthy rate of losing weight (per week) is between 0.5kg and 0.9kg (any more and they risk losing muscle etc.). If they were to lose 0.5kg exactly per week (the lower bound) it would take them approximately 6 months. Why? I'll show you now. Losing 0.5kg a week means losing 2kg in a month. He wants to lose 12kg (90-78= 12). 12/2 = 6 months. Now, by following this approach Man 1 has maintained a 'decent' amount of muscle and is happier and healthier. Man 2, however, wants to lose 12kg (explained above) within 3 months. That means 4kg a month. They do this, but at what benefit? Man 2 loses muscle mass and is considerably weaker. They also feel a lot worse about themselves. Now, let me ask you this, is it beneficial to take the 'safer' and 'healthier' method at double the time, or take half the time but overall you are in a worse position? I, personally, would take Man 1's approach. That is much more realistic, as opposed to them 'fad' diets people read.\\n\\nI'm not losing fat on my face only, what am I doing wrong?\\n\\nSpoiler: Show \\n\\nOften, people wonder - why can't I lose my face fat? Or something along them lines. Whether it be face fat or belly fat or thigh fat, YOU CAN'T SPOT REDUCE. Doing 1 hour of crunches or 1 hour of leg lifts does not = fat loss. I'm sorry, but that's the reality. I'm not going to sugar-coat the truth. In order to 'slim' down and lose whatever fat you're looking to lose, you need to be in a caloric deficit. However, keep in mind, even by losing weight you're not guaranteed perfection. You don't decide where you lose fat, your body does.\\n\\nI'm doing everything right, why am I not losing weight?\\n\\nSpoiler: Show \\n\\nThis is another common question, and the likelihood is that you're experiencing a plateau. Pretty much, it means you've gotten to a point, where your body has adapted to your workouts, and due to this, it isn't improving. How can you fix this? Well you could:\\nIncrease your workout intensity.\\nTry doing new exercises, if you continuously do an exercise (depending on what your goals are, as it varies) it often gets quite boring.\\nLift weights (if you aren't already). This is because, having muscle increases your metabolism and helps you lose fat.\\n\\nI'm gaining weight on a caloric deficit, why?\\n\\nSpoiler: Show \\n\\nNow, you've stepped onto the scale and it says you've gained weight. Don't panic, this is completely normal (for the most part). Why? I'll explain now. Even if your weight increases, you may still be losing body fat. Muscle, in general, is more dense than fat and it takes up less space. Also, if you're taking regular measurements and you're losing inches, you're doing it right (even if the scale says otherwise). It's not always a reliable method to look at the scales. However, that said, if the above points don't apply, then you're doing it wrong. You may be eating in a caloric surplus due to not accurately understanding what you're eating. If this is the case, reevaluate your diet and make sure you're in a deficit.\\n\\n\\nDoes Keto etc. work?\\n\\nSpoiler: Show \\n\\nMany of you have heard of diets such as Keto etc. and you may be wondering - does it work? Now, to bluntly answer this question, yes diets such as Keto and Atkins do work. However, are they sustainable and good for the future? No, they're not. Why? I'll elaborate now. Let's look at why these diets work. They aren't a magical formula for success, nor are they any more beneficial than eating 'healthily' and in moderation (explained later on). The reason as to why these all work are because - they place you in a caloric deficit. Nothing more, nothing less. They aren't 'good' for long term sustainability. Let's look at Keto. The main principle is that it follows a 'very low carb' and 'high fat' approach i.e. it involves drastically reducing carbohydrate intake and replacing it with fat. This is good, right? No. I'll tell you why. Keto diets have you eliminate certain food groups and hence a variety of food choices are 'banned' for you. For example, on a Keto diet one may not have:\\nSugary foods, Grains or starches, Fruit, Beans or Legumes, Alcohol and Sugar-free diet foods etc. This, in my opinion, is quite frankly stupid and far too unrealistic for an 'average' person. Now, am I saying don't follow it? No, I'm not advocating whether you should follow it or not, I'm merely explaining why I believe it's too restrictive and how you can enjoy foods, such as fruit, without being on Keto. I mean, seriously? Not allowed fruits? It's stupid, honestly. But hey, if it works for you, do what you do.\\n\\nHow often should I eat to lose weight?\\n\\nSpoiler: Show \\n\\nThis is quite easy to answer really. It doesn't matter how often you eat, but what matters is that you're in a caloric deficit for them meals. For example, let's say your intake is 2500 calories a day. Using this, we can see that a deficit of 500 calories is needed for a 'safe' and 'healthy' weight loss. Now, you have 2000 calories to consume. How you do it, doesn't matter. You could have 2 meals at 1000 calories or 5 meals at 400 calories. As long as you're in a deficit, that's all that matters.\\n\\nCan I eat whatever I want and lose weight?\\n\\nSpoiler: Show \\n\\nQuite contrary to the popular belief, you can eat whatever you want to and lose weight. Surely not, right? Wrong. Of course you can. It doesn't matter whether you eat pizza or chocolate or salads to lose weight, if you were in a deficit you would lose weight. However, that said, there's an important point to add. Most times people hear that you have to eat fruit and vegetables and avoid chocolate, but they're never told why. I'll tell you now. Eating 2000 calories (example above given) of chocolate and 2000 calories of fruit and vegetables, are two completely different things. What matters here is the satiety effect of the foods. What I mean by this, is that eating fruits and vegetables will give you more satisfaction and hence make you feel more satiated, thus making weight loss easier. However, having 2000 calories of pizza is likely not going to keep you as satiated as the fruits and vegetables would. What matters here the most, is moderation. By this, I mean having the foods you enjoy (whilst in a deficit) and eating 'healthily'. I, personally, would recommend the 80:20 approach. For example, let's say you eat 3 meals a day. That's 21 meals a week. Now, 80% of the 21 meals should be 'healthy' and 'wholesome' foods incorporated. That means out of 21 meals, 16.8 i.e. 17 meals should follow this. The other 4, however, can be 'unhealthy' and whatever you like to eat. This, imo, is the key to success and long term results.\\n\\nWhat's more important: Diet or Exercise?\\n\\nSpoiler: Show \\n\\nThere's a saying that goes around, diet is 80% and exercise is 20%. This is 100% true. Why? I'll tell now. You can't outdo a bad diet, you can, however, make your diet 'clean' (explained above) and simply follow it. That way, you're getting the best results for long term, and there's no fear of going on 'fad' diets and consequently gaining all the weight back. That said, make sure your workouts are tough and don't involve you being lazy in the gym; expecting results from not working out hard is unrealistic and unreasonable.\\n\\nHow do I know how much calories I need?\\n\\nSpoiler: Show \\n\\nI would personally recommend this calculator (linked at the end of this point) where you can input your details to find out, what you need. Keep in mind, however, not all calculators are accurate. The only way you'll find out what works for you is through 'trial and error'. Calculators aren't always accurate, but as a starting point it can certainly help. Try having a deficit of 500 calories. Work out your TDEE and eat 500 calories less than that figure. This way, you're ensuring that you have a slow and healthy weight loss.\\n\\nhttps://tdeecalculator.net/\\n\\nWhat is the best approach to losing weight?\\n\\nSpoiler: Show \\n\\nThe best approach whilst losing weight imo, is to take it slow and easy. Don't restrict certain food groups, don't go on any 'fad' diets and certainly don't starve yourselves. Follow an 80:20 rule (explained above) and have moderation. You can count calories, but don't go too far. For example, if you're going to obsess about taking a scale with you, whilst eating out, you're better off without this method. But, if you manage it correctly, counting calories is very fun and easy to do, and it does make a difference whilst losing weight.\\n\\nWhat are some tips when trying to lose weight?\\n\\nSpoiler: Show \\n\\nHere are some general tips whilst trying to lose weight:\\nDon't skip meals (honestly most people do, and it's bad imo). If you're in a deficit, you can certainly enjoy breakfast (but it is up to personal preference).\\nDon't lose weight too quickly.\\nDon't avoid the scale, but don't rely on it to measure your progress.\\nDon't go on any strict diets.\\nGet enough sleep.\\nDon't abuse 'fake' fat burners which don't help you.\\nWalk 10000 steps a day.\\nDrink plenty of water.\\nEat satiating foods to help with hunger.\\nEat enough protein.\\nDo strength training.\\nQuick point to mention: YOU CAN'T BREAK THE LAWS OF THERMODYNAMICS.\\n\\nIf anyone has anything to add/wants to correct me, please feel free to.\\nDax_Swagg3r Nutritionist Reality Check AM.TSR Realitysreflexx Gone Revising II Smack RichPiana \\n\\n\\nIf I've forgotten anyone I'm sorry.\", 'I went from 89kg to 86kg from drinking water and watching what I eat.

I was potentially thinking about buying some middle-ground calorie snacks that are still tasty but not full of sugar, and slowly eating them at a normal pace of like one a day, rather than binge eating chocolate at the end of the week.

Basically I am 18 years old now,  I went down from 136.5 Kg down to 86 in 6 month. I am writing this in the hopes that it would ignite the fire of change in someone who has similar circumstances as I did. below is my story.\\n\\nSo, 6 month ago, my scale read the highest it has ever read, a stunning 136.5 Kg... I remember this time like it was yesterday. I had so many health problems that I honestly thought I wouldn\\'t make it to my 18th birthday. My blood pressure was constantly in the 160-180 range (The normal is 120). My glucose level (unsurprisingly) was always over the roof. Also, very simple tasks like tying my shoe laces would leave me panting like crazy and gasping for air. At night, things didn\\'t get any better, I couldn\\'t sleep except in one certain pose because all that fat was pressuring on my heart and lungs and made me feel like I was choking. My knees were constantly doing weird noises and hurt me whenever I sat for prolonged times. Bottom line was that my health was absolutely **** to say the least. \\n\\n\\nSocially, it was also horrible, most people constantly teased me in an effort to urge me to lose weight (Which surprisingly doesn\\'t work). I also really liked this girl a lot and after an eternity of building up courage to ask her, I was brutally turned down (And Yes she mentioned  my weight when turning me down , even though she \"likes my personality\" ). Although my friends always supported me no matter what, they always tried to urge me to lose weight.\\n\\n\\nLike any obese/overweight person, I tried a gazillion different diets and \"secret detox\" methods which failed miserably for only one reason. I did not have the right mind set for loosing weight. Did I want to loose weight? HELL YES. Did I understand what it took to loose and keep off all that weight? NO... That is when I realized that I needed something more than get the right diet. I needed to change my thinking about nutrition, exercise, and my view on my lifestyle overall.\\n\\n\\nI am not going to lie, when I first started six month ago, my first goal was to lose the weight for that girl. I wanted to lose weight so she would accept me. Now I am not saying that you should lose weight for your crush or your BF/GF but it was definitely what ignited my change. At that time I couldn\\'t exercise at all due to my weight so I just stuck to changing my diet eliminating all sodas and fizzy drinks/junk oily foods. Also, I started eating only green food with some proteins. This was enough for me to lose the first 15 Kg. By that time, I started feeling less pressure when sleeping and my health generally got better. In addition, I was able to start exercising so I started walking on the treadmill every two days for an hour. By the time I hit 20 kg off, I was determined that this weight was going to be off forever. \\n\\nBy this time, I started digging the internet on articles and information about nutrition and health in general, I became obsessed with what I put in my body and would eat according to fixed proportions. I also started hitting the iron-bars gym that has all the iron tools and I started doing low weights high number of reps to build some muscles but not too much. I followed this lifestyle till I hit 40 Kg off. Then I started increasing the weights to start building muscle mass and I started increasing the proteins intake in my diet while maintaining the green food. Of course, I would occasionally crumble and binge eat but I made sure there was healthy good tasting food in the house to binge eat on (Like eat 10 bars of Caramel flavored oatmeal bars), or sometimes enjoy some chocolates and sweets as a change. But overall, I maintained this life style till I reached the 50 Kg off goal in the 6 month.\\n\\nSo to recap quickly (or the too long didn\\'t read version)\\n1) Gave up on fizzy drinks, chips, oily food, junk food in general and started eating any healthy food.\\n2) Once I lost enough weight to be able to exercise, I started walking on the treadmill and switched to green food (there is plenty of DELICIOUS green food recipes on the internet, so dig them and get creative)\\n3) after loosing more weight and my body starting to shape properly, I hit the iron gym and started lifting light weights for many reps. That and maintaining the green food.\\n4) After my body started to look, normal/a little bit chubby, I started increasing the weight to build a greater muscle mass. while still eating green.\\n\\n\\nSo here I am 6 month later, 50 kg off, blood pressure back to normal, glucose level average, and can sleep however I want. top size dropped from 4 XL to L. As for the girl, well sometime during my journey I decided that someone who doesn\\'t accept me and support me in any state I am in isn\\'t worth asking  \\n\\nI really hope I ignited the spark in anyone with similar circumstances, If I can, you Can too!!\\n\\nI would love to answer any questions you have.', 'Consuming two and a half kilos of sugar via eating is obviously unrealistic as you’d be sick as a dog long before you managed to finish eating it.

On the other hand, households with more than one car may no longer be able to afford one, so will have to sell one and have the entire household share the other.

On the outward journey I got away with it, but on the return a young woman conductor was checking tickets and noticed I did not look 15. Obviously I tried to lie about my age, but then she pointed out i’d have to be at school, which surprised me, throwing me off. She threatened to phone the school, to both check if I was telling the truth and if they knew I wasn’t there. (I was a little dumb to be lying about my age travelling on a train 12pm on a monday), to which I gave in and told her my actual age. But she was sound, telling me she could take this as fraud and report me to the authorities to which i’d have to attend court at a later date. She also said because I had already used the outward ticket this would only support the case against me, and i’d have to pay the original fee plus any fine the court would decide. Or I could pay the penalty fee (think it was £40/£60) Plus the original ticket, plus any further tickets to where I was going.

This particular night, it was cold and rainy so it didn\\'t particularly help my mood.\\n\\nThe bus was supposed to arrive at 10:20pm quite simply, as stated by the information card on the bus stop. It eventually arrived 15 minutes later than expected at 10:35pm. At this point, I was in a pretty **** mood. As soon as I got on, I had the following dialogue with the bus driver.\\n\\nMe: *taps Oyster* Why was the bus 15 minutes late? It\\'s supposed to arrive at 10:20pm\\nDriver: *Chortle* Don\\'t you know how buses are? Have you never been on one?\\nMe: Right, why was it late? A lot of customers or what...? (take note, the bus was only carrying a few people, and the roads were almost empty)\\nDriver: I just told you why it was late, not that I have to tell you y\\'know\\nMe: No, you haven\\'t. Why was it late? I\\'m asking for a reason as to why you haven\\'t arrived at the time you were supposed to?\\nDriver: Look, I don\\'t have to tell you anything. I\\'ve already explained to you why I was late..\\n\\n*At this point, a fellow passenger piped up and said \"Look, I\\'m late too..\" pointing to the fact that we\\'d been stood still for a minute or so by this point. I decide forgo my confrontation with the driver and sit down, apologising to the passenger who\\'d spoken up, explaining that I was simply quite peeved. After the journey, I got off and had to cross the road. The bus passed me, but as he was turning the corner of the junction, the driver decided to stare me down with what I perceived to be an intentionally derisive glare.\\n\\nIn all honesty, if the bus driver had simply held his hands up and said \"Look, I\\'m sorry for the delay in service, I know I\\'m late..\" I would have shrugged it off, at least it would have been courteous. But it was his self-righteous attitude that he has no obligation to the paying customers that use the service. It makes me angry that union workers like this man have a bloated ego that makes them think they can provide a sub-par service to paying customers and not even go so far as to apologise for it. I\\'ll note that I DIDN\\'T use abusive or offensive language. I was quite visibly peeved, but I wasn\\'t threatening in my tone or my language.\\n\\nThe notion that people like this who demand higher pay, more holidays and strike left right and centre only to provide a poop smear of a service to paying individuals, really ticks me off.

Save yourself some trouble and go somewhere else. It all started positive and I got some great help with my visa before departure. Second, compared with other students, my internship was great. However, once I arrived, I immediately noticed that Mrs likes to gossip about people. But this was nothing to be worried about, at that moment. I, and others were simply dumped in a house which was simply falling apart. Open sewerage in the house which made the house smell terrible every half an hour, rats running through our living room, cold showers in the beginning, washing machine where your clothes come out more dirty then when you put it in, no alarm nor fences to “protect” the people in the house. This attracted many homeless people, of which one slept underneath our window. And, on top of that, leakage in the house. As we only had one small radiator to heat the house, the whole house was terribly cold, miserable and damp. The leakage was already mentioned in month two and it was supposedly “fixed”. Nothing could be further from the truth when a new rainstorm arrived. It rained each two days, so the house was like this all the time. Where water was dripping literally everywhere, dangerously slippery floor. But, as Mrs later said, due to ramadan it would take longer. You know, because literally every roofworker is muslim and cannot work. I checked with an old housemate months after I left, and it has not fixed since. My housemates and I wanted to talk with her face to face in a professional manner. She emailed us back with “my girl, i am in this business for x years...”. In her way of communicating she obviously felt better than us, belittled us, and if we “complained” one more time, we would get kicked out the house. Lastly, besides gossiping, Mrs also loves to tell you that people “do not like you” or any other negative rumours. We checked these rumours with these people. Nothing was true. As I can look into the future, I foresee XChange commenting on this review saying it was aaallllll my fault and none was theirs. You will see.

Try to find a place/room that includes bills and don\\'t be afraid of negotiating your rent price as well. Typically, if you are renting a whole property, the landlord/lady might give you a reduction in the overall price if you rent for over a year as they don\\'t want to pay agency fees again in finding new tenants.\\n\\nIf your place does include bills...find cheap providers! That\\'s all I can say. If the house you live in can have a smart meter then add it!\\n\\n2) Grocery wise: y e l l o w  s t i c k e r s !\\n\\nLife-changing honestly, I usually shop on Sunday evenings when they want to throw stuff out and it saves me so much money! When I can\\'t find food that I want from Lidl, I usually go to the supermarkets and search for the reduced items. Keep in mind that you can freeze produce as well. \\n\\nAn app that is really useful is TooGoodToGo, a lot of the restaurants and cafes around London use this app too to reduce their food waste. Food is actually really decent because usually, it\\'s just leftovers from breakfast or lunch before they change their menu to the evening menu. Check the app more than once a day though, as it can update quite frequently.\\n\\n3) Scavenge for furniture!\\n\\nIf you are missing anything in your room or want more furniture, there are a lot of apps or websites where you can get it for free.\\n\\nSwapabee is a free online platform where you can swap items you don\\'t need for something else. As they say, \"where one man\\'s rubbish may be another man’s treasure\" haha. It\\'s a great app because there\\'s literally everything you could possibly imagine.

I've updated the original guide with some more recent information. \\n\\n\\nHi All, \\n\\nWelcome to the Matched Betting thread - the new trend for students in making some money! \\n\\nThis thread is intended to be a reference guide with tips and links to  various way in which you can take advantage of this lucrative method of  making money. \\n\\nMatched betting can be done automatically or manually - this thread  covers both automatic methods and manual methods. Manual methods involve  users researching, calculating and carrying out the matched bet.  Automatic methods are usually websites or software that automates this. \\n\\nThe following is a comprehensive guide from Wolvarium that covers the  basics of both automatic and manual methods with some very useful  reference links. \\n\\n\\nWhat is Matched Betting?\\n\\nMatched Betting is where you take advantage of a bookmaker's special offers by covering all outcomes when you place your bets, ensuring that you make a profit regardless of outcome. \\n\\nIs it risk free?\\n\\nMost offers are entirely risk free. Some have a small element of risk but are mathematically favourable to give you profit. \\nOf course there is always human error or unforeseeable events that are  out of your control but it is “risk-free” in the truest sense of the  word.\\nThere are offers you can decide to do that are “low-risk” but it is entirely your choice whether you want to do them or not.\\n\\nHow much can I make?\\n\\nThis really depends on how much time you commit to it. If you complete a lot  of the sign-up offers available then you can easily make around £1000.\\nThere are other ways of making money, revolving around the same  principle, which I will explain in greater detail below. After doing the  sign-up offers, you can utilise these methods and make large amounts of  money. \\n\\nMost people make around £300-£500 per month putting in a couple of hours each week. Those who do it alot or commit to it full time can make anywhere between £2000 - £5000 reliably every month. \\n\\nThis Blog has been going for just over a year now and keeps a running total of profit, averaging about £2k every month. \\n\\nWhere can I learn?\\n\\nThere are various resources you can use that help you to get to grips  with how the process of matched betting works. I will list some of them  here.\\n\\n\\nProfit Accumulator\\nThe biggest Matched Betting guide site. Has an excellent tutorial for new users and offers a free trial which you will make about £45 from. Large and active forums and good customer support. \\n\\nProfit Maximiser\\nOne of the very early guide sites. Not as good for new people but offers far more information for those looking to do the more advanced offers including casino and bingo. \\n\\n\\nHow can I find offers?\\n\\nMBG Free Bets\\nIncludes some short instructions for each offers\\n\\nFree Bets For All\\nAnother site that lists more bookies. Word of warning though, some of  the bookmaker's on the list are a bit dodgy and would be worth  researching. More on that later.\\n\\nMoney Saving Expert\\nMoneysavingexpert is an excellent, reputable forum, dedicated to saving money.\\nOn the matched betting section of the forum you will find a strict  policy of only risk-free offers being discussed here. This is a good  place to keep track of the newest sign-up offers, and other offers  bookmaker's may have for existing customers on their website.\\nReading threads on the forum will also get you accustomed to some of the more complicated aspects of Matched Betting.\\n\\nThe Gambling Times\\nA word of warning for this one. It's not for newbies as it often lists offers that are not risk free.\\nThis site is brilliant for listing offers and the latest news. The  downside is, to gain access to the private (and best) areas of the forum  you need to pay a premium fee of £28. This will give you full access to  the forum, and the chatbox.\\nIn my opinion this is well worth the money and the site has paid for itself many times over.\\nThey do a 48 hour free trial for those that want to see what the website is like.\\n\\nWarning: The following probably won't make any sense unless you already understand how matched betting works.\\n\\nWhat types of offers are there?\\n\\nWell there are several types of offers.\\n\\nSNR and SR: Firstly you'll come across the letters SNR and SR. \\nSNR means a stake not returned freebet. These mean that the actual £25  stake of the freebet is not returned with the winnings. So if you bet  £25 of your own money on odds of 2.0 (evens) then you'd expect to get  £50 back (£25 of your own money and £25 “profit”). With a SNR freebet  you would only get £25 back. For SNR bets as the stake is not returned  with the winnings, to get the best profits you need to bet on high odds  e.g. around 4 or 5 and higher.\\n\\nSR means the opposite. This is a stake returned freebet. This means that  with the example above you would get £50 back, the £25 freebet stake  would be returned with the winnings.\\n\\nMinimum Odds: There are almost always minimum odds you need to bet on  for your bet to count towards the sign-up offer. Say it is a bet £25 get  £25 freebet offer, bookies will normally state that e.g. Bets must be  placed on odds of evens (2.0) or greater. If your bet is placed on lower  odds it won't count for the offer and you won't get the freebet. You  can, however, place your bet on odds higher than this requirement.\\n\\nThe standard bet x amount and get x amount as a freebet: These offers  are the simplest where you bet e.g. £25 and you get given a £25 freebet  that you can bet and withdraw once the bet is settled.\\n\\nDeposit x, get x straight away: Another common offer is one where you  deposit e.g. £30 and get £30 credited instantly into your balance. Then  your whole balance (£60) has to be wagered e.g. 5 times. This just means  you have to wager £300 worth (60x5). You can normally do this any way  you like, and in any number of bets, unless the terms and conditions  state otherwise. The freebet is often SR with these kinds of offers.\\n\\nNo-lose freebets: These are generally e.g. bet £20 and if it loses  you'll be given a £20 freebet. You can get guaranteed profit from these  types of offers by laying less than you usually do. If you treat both  bets as SNR then you can usually guarantee e.g. £15 out of the £20. \\nThis can be quite a complicated offer to understand and it is best to  ask if you don't fully understand or don't feel confident doing it.\\n\\nWager x amount and unlock x bonus to withdraw: There are offer that only  give a bonus once you have wagered a set amount e.g. wagering £800 to  unlock £100. The wagering can generally be done any way you like and  once the bonus money is unlocked you can normally withdraw it straight  away.\\n\\nThere are other types of offers but my aim is to produce an overview of the most common ones, not an exhaustive list.\\n\\n\\nI've done all the sign-up offers I can find. What next?\\n\\nWell chances are you haven't done every sign-up offer there is so it's worth having a thorough look around.\\nBut if you're willing to carry on making money there are other branches  of “Matched betting” that are very profitable. I will mention a few.\\n\\n\\nArbitrage Betting: This is when you find back odds considerably higher  than the lay odds and you place your own money on these odds to make a  profit. It is common for arbers to underlay to ensure more profit if the  bet wins in the bookmaker. There is big money to be made here, and  there are usually plenty of arbs to be found on horse racing for the  main UK bookies, and plenty on other events (depending on the bookie)  such as football, darts, tennis, golf, formula one etc...\\n\\nCasino Offers: These are not strictly risk free. They generally involve  depositing a set amount, completing a certain amount of wagering to  achieve the bonus money. The wagering is usually done on blackjack or  similarly low-risk games such as casino hold-em. The wagering can then  be completed with (hopefully) minimum losses and you can walk away with  profit. Unfortunately these “profitable” casino offers are becoming more  and more scarce. Best place to find these offers would be  thegamblingtimes.\\n\\nReload Offers and offers for existing customers: There are often offers  for existing customers that may give you e.g. a £10 bonus for depositing  £10 or Deposit £300 get £100 and wager x amount of times to withdraw.  Big reload offers don't come along often but they all add up!\\n\\n\\nHints and advice\\n\\n\\nUse Smarkets as much as possible. It has a lower commission percentage (2%) compared to Betfair (5%)\\n\\nThe most importance piece of advice I can give is to read the terms and  conditions. Always know what the bookie is asking of you so that you  make the most of the offer and don't mess it up.\\n\\nResearch the less well-known bookmakers to see if they are respectable.  There are too many cases of a bookmaker going bankrupt or simply closing  down, taking people's money with them. \\nA simple search on the moneysavingexpert forum can help you with this.\\n\\nI would also recommend \\nSports Book Reviews\\n\\nCashback: There are websites like Topcashback and Quidco that provide  cashback (money) for joining a bookmaker through them and fulfilling set  criteria. It is well worth having a look and seeing if you can make  some extra cash. \\n\\nHuman Error: Everyone is vulnerable to human error. Whether starting out  or having had years of practice, we all make mistakes. It's worth  checking your bets and making sure you have done everything right.\\n\\nLaying error: If you find you have layed too much , don't panic. By  backing the same outcome that you layed you can cancel out the excess  lay amount. Don't forget, most mistakes on betfair are rectifiable due  to it being an exchange and the ability to back and lay to cancel out. \\n\\nMoneybookers: If you don't like giving card details to places or are  thinking of getting into arbing then I'd recommend moneybookers.\\nThis is an e-wallet, like paypal, but widely accepted by bookmakers. \\nWarnings: Always check the terms and conditions for offers as some do  NOT allow moneybookers and you will not get the freebet if you deposit  via this method.\\nMoneybookers charge for deposits and withdrawals to and from your bank  if you do it via card. You can deposit for free via a 3-5 day bank  transfer but cannot get around the small fee for withdrawals.\\n\\nDepositing and withdrawing to and from bookmakers is almost always free.\\nThese charges are well worth the convenience of faster withdrawals from bookies and the convenience of re-using your profits.\\nYou cannot realistically arb a lot without having a moneybookers account.\\nIf you achieve VIP status on moneybookers then you are not charged.\\n\\n\\nReferals: Places like Betfair, moneybookers and Topcashback (as well as a select number of bookmakers) have referal programmes.\\nIf you are referred to betfair then both you and the referrer will get £25.\\nFor Moneybookers and Topcashback the referral programme only benefits the referer.\\n\\nHowever it doesn't require much effort and is always worth letting  yourself be referred by somebody. The good turn may be returned in  future and you will most likely get the opportunity to refer others.\\n\\nThere is also referals board on moneysavingexpert for people that are interested.\\n\\n\\nGlossary\\n\\nUnderlaying: Underlaying is when you lay less than you would, doing a  normal offer ( to get the same amount of profit either side). The result  of this is that you'll get more profit if the bet wins in the bookie  and less if it wins in betfair. This is a common tactic when dealing  with large wagering requirements and arbs.\\nOverlaying: The opposite to underlaying. Laying more than normal. This  will get you more profit in betfair but less in the bookie.\\nDutching: This is where, instead of laying a bet on the exchange, you  use another (or several) bookmakers to back the other outcomes, thus  covering all eventualities. This is useful as it avoids the commission  betfair charges yet is generally more effort, but can provide greater  profit.\\nLiquidity: This term is usually used with regards to Betfair. Betfair is  an exchange and not like a bookmaker. The numbers under each odds  refers to the amount you can stake on those particular odds. If your  stake exceeds the liquidity then your bet may get taken if more  liquidity comes on the market, or you may have to cancel and put the  rest on slightly higher odds that have liquidity.\\nFloat: This is the amount of money you have to use. Your float doesn't  refer to profits or money invested. It merely refers to the total amount  of money you have at your disposal that you're using for matched  betting.\\n\\n\\nThanks for Reading!\\n\\nI'm sure I've missed stuff out that I may add later but generally I  wanted this guide to be a simple explanation of what matched betting is,  and to help newcomers to get to grips with the basics.\\n\\nIf anyone needs any help or has any questions then feel free to PM me,  or ask on the forum where there are plenty of lovely people willing to  help! \\n\\nEnjoy watching the money roll in\", 'Has anyone switched to a student account in preparation for uni?\\nI currently have an under 19s and was considering switching soon since many others have said student accounts have lots of perks.\\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on this?', 'A month ago I was wrongfully given a CIFAS marker by nationwide for a payment which they deemed fraudulent and closed my account for.

Kids who are working for other kids = employees\\n2.       Kids for who other kids are working for = employers\\n3.       The actions all the kids do for one another = trade\\n4.       The current rules trying to specify what is allowed and what is not = law\\n\\nThe actions kids do for one another, when they have fun together are generally “I do this for you, you do that for me”, and specifically what this and that is for each occasion.\\n\\nWhen they have fun separately generally “either me or you don’t do their part”, and specifically you or me find this out for the specific occasion, at the specific point in time.\\n\\nFor the employees , the above are enough.\\n\\nFor the employers, they are trying to find ways so that “I do this for you, you do that for me” needs less time and effort spend to trade.\\n\\nThis is the purpose of the economy in a society, to reduce the time and effort spend to trade.\\n\\nThis reduction goes on up to a minimum point for the time and effort needed to trade, beyond which things start becoming not fun in society, and kids then need more time and effort spend to trade, because kids don’t do “I do this for you, you do that for me”, they are doing something else.\\n\\nAs fun in society affects where the economy balances, the particular behaviors kids have, affect the economy as well, regardless of the scale of the economy we consider. This can be verified from small teams, to the entire planet, and throughout human history.\\n\\nKids have many varied behaviors, so we will name kids the jokers.\\n\\nRegardless of whether the jokers are employers or employees, they can be happy kids, kids who have fun in their lives, or sad kids, kids who are not having fun in their lives. \\n\\nWhether kids are having fun or not is judged by other kids, according to what is fun for them.\\n\\nSo we have funny jokers, and sad jokers.\\n\\nFunny jokers, in the end just want to have fun, so when the fun they have covers their needs, they don’t need to go further.\\n\\nSad jokers spend time and effort to trade, but they are not having fun. Because others spend time and effort to trade, plus have fun, sad jokes need to become good at something else in order to compete.\\n\\nSo they spend their time and effort on something else, on which they become efficient. Because they become efficient at something else other than reducing the time and effort spend to trade, they can either not affect the economy, but then they wouldn’t be part of the economy, or increase the time and effort spend to trade in the economy. This happens in accordance to their position in society, and the bigger they grow, the more time and effort needs to be spend to trade, up to the point where the economy goes in a cycle, and returns back to reality.\\n\\nBecause of this, what is no one’s problem in society, becomes everyone’s problem in society. Why? Because some jokers are sad and this is funny. Why? Because others aren’t and they are useful to society.\\n\\nLaw is trying to specify what is allowed and what is not, however kids judge other kids on whether they are having fun, according to what is fun for them. \\n\\nLaw is reducing the time and effort spend to trade, when kids judging other kids on whether they are having fun is not restricted, or when law is common sense for kids, and increasing the time and effort spend to trade, when kids judging other kids on whether they are having fun is restricted. \\n\\nBecause it is the nature of kids to judge other kids on whether they are having fun, isn’t it?', 'I’m looking to open a student bank account by September for when I go to university however I’m a little worried that that I won’t be accepted.

Utilities again are small as my Partner and I split them 50/50, so each month I pay no more than £250 in utilities. (When I say utilities I mean literally every single cost around the home - so that includes gas, electric, insurance, water, broadband & TV, service charges). So yeah, all in all, it costs me no more than £500 to run the home (£463 to be precise). \\n\\nMy justification is that lots of students pay approx £500 a month in their rent, which includes rent and their utilities ( and the uni I am looking at going to is no cheaper than £600 a month), so my mortgage repayments plus all my utilities are cheaper than what a typical student pays. That then leaves me with approx £300 a month for other stuff. \\n\\nMy food each month is never any more than £100 and my personal direct debits (phone, car insurance etc) comes to £98 per month, although I am thinking that if I go to uni I will ditch my car. That then leaves me with £100 left. Obviously, I'm planning on also getting a part time job to bring in an extra £200-£300 a month too.\\n\\nSo yeah, I am very confident in my plan purely because I know that most students pay at least £500 to rent in student halls / rented accommodation, whereas mine is that little bit less. After paying for my living costs, I then have to find money for food things like a phone bill, but that's something that every student has to do... \\n\\nBut yeah, even though I am very confident in my plan, I am still feeling a little bit nervous about the whole thing.

To kick off, I have a Bachelors in Chemistry with Biomedicine from King’s College London and graduated last summer, managing to get a 2:1, though only just. In truth I hated the degree. I don’t come from a well off financial background and one of the main reasons I went to university was so I could have a higher earning potential. I was scared of failing in my first year but was actually doing well, but then my grandmother died. Another reason I went was to make my family proud. I don’t have a father, so I was raised by my mother and grandparents. My grandfather died before I could get into university. Now all that’s left is my mother, and a half brother I don’t get in with (thought that’s something for another time). I still did well in my first year, but I don’t have much more than my family. I wanted time to grieve and in all honesty I was already at odds with my degree but after my gran died, I hated it even more. I’m not naturally smart and found it difficult. Plus in my second and final years, I wasn’t happy with the level of teaching. I’ll go more into that in the comments, however it’s worth stating that for two Physical Chemistry modules, I was better off teaching myself from YouTube. TMP Chem is the name of the channel in case you guys are wondering. I had 3 breakdowns in my final year during exam season. I hadn’t cried this much since my grandmother died, but I pulled it off by some miracle. My mother was a little unhappy with me not wanting to pursue a Masters, telling everyone about her high expectations of me. But I hated my subject and I don’t think putting myself another year into debt is a wise choice, especially since 1.) I was lucky to get the grade I wanted, which was heavily expected of me, and 2.) there’s no guarantee of what I’m going to be doing afterwards. I’d rather just be earning a living though I am more than happy to learn what I need to and work hard to get by. Mum seems to be disappointed with my not wanting to be a doctor or a dentist but I don’t feel like I’m cut out for it. I know that there are other ways to be financially well off like investing long term, something she didn’t bother to tell me about, which is why I’m teaching myself. I’m also learning about fitness because everyone in my family is overweight except me. My mother is in fact clinically obese. I’m actually doing ok, but am hoping to bulk up and see where I can go with this. Also, people in my family tend to give up a lot. My mother actually was no exception. I don’t think people really have to sacrifice their fitness goals whatever they are to be successful as well. So I’m gonna put in some time with the fitness industry just to gain some experience and people skills. I’m not knocking school or university but contrary to my mother’s opinion, I didn’t learn everything I need for later life, so I’m reading as much as I can to make up for that. Still I’m wondering what kind of careers I can have alongside fitness, as I plan to have a safe career while helping people achieve their own fitness goals. I’ve taken my education seriously. I just don’t want any more student debt. It’s easy for my mother to say I wouldn’t be paying a King’s ransom when she’s not the one who has to pay it. You see I want to start earning as soon as possible because I also want to move out as soon as possible. I live with an abusive brother and my mother doesn’t have the spine to kick him out. I am hard working and determined, though I do have bouts of depression sometimes. I haven’t been diagnosed but I do feel similar to how I felt when my gran died sometimes. Not wanting to wake up. But I’m getting better. Any advice? I don’t know what else I have to offer. I tutored under my mother’s instruction, but the clients I had didn’t pay much.

Luckily for me, my parents have been saving money  for me for a long time so I have a large reserve of money which I could use to pay student loans. As I will be studying medicine, I'm very likely to be employed for the rest of my life and will be earning a lot within the first 10-11 years (£80,000-£100,000). Even in the first couple of years I will probably be earning over the £25,000 threshold. In addition to this, having taken out  a loan of about £50,000 I'm likely to be paying back around £100,000 over the 30 years of repayment and it's unlikely that I'll be able to pay it off. 9% of overall income seems like a lot to me!\\nHowever, I have also heard that it's best to keep this money in the account to later use for a deposit on a house etc. Even with the money I have I still won't be able to pay all the tuition fees and living fees myself so I'll still have some money to pay off throughout my life, and it's also been said that interest rates for student loans are low so I may end up doing better having kept the money to spend later if I need. Also, if I don't spend the money I will end up in a very good financial position at the end of university.\\nIf anyone has any advice or has been in a similar situation please let me know!

I was initially looking for accommodation with a group of 2nd year medics but then my mum wanted to buy a 1bed flat for me so we would save money in the long run, given that I\\'m a med student and renting is much more expensive.\\n\\nI agreed and we were looking since Nov 2019. We managed to find a nice 1 bed flat and put in an offer that the seller  was happy with. However, 2 weeks ago, we received an email from the estate agent saying that the seller would only \"accept\" our offer if we moved into the house from June 2020 onwards and paid rent until September. And then after this, she was going to sell us the house. The reason for this is because due to COVID, the current tenant staying in the house was moving out and the owner was going to lose out on rent.\\n\\nNow, seeing as I\\'m a student who is already in rented accommodation, how did she expect us to pay for 2 places at once. It just seems so unreasonable!\\n\\nWe were very angry and thought it strange at how she dismissed our offer [after agreeing to it!] and so we decided to pull out of the offer we\\'d made.\\n\\nHowever, due to the COVID situation, I am back home and there have been no new property listings to buy. It\\'s also too late to try and rent a place for next year as many people have already found housing and studios have sold out.\\n\\nI start uni the 1st week of September as I\\'m going into 3rd year and am really stressed out about how to deal with this situation. \\n\\nCan someone suggest something. I feel like I\\'m out of options and I\\'m very anxious, which is not doing me any good as I have 2nd year exams coming up as well. I feel like uni accommodation is also only for 1st years and I don\\'t think they can help.\\n\\nI just don\\'t know what to do anymore.

Cant wait to heat your thoughts on it )', \"I'm looking  to hear what you guys think, Do I have a gambling addiction?\\n\\nFirst of all i'd like to clarify that all of my gambling has to do with sports betting, specifically Football. I don't do roulette blackjack etc.\\n\\nStarted around a week ago with £25, betting in-plays on football matches, and within a couple of hours i'd found my balance grew to £70 odd. I hadn't really had a strategy, I'd just been betting on number of goals etc. Then stupidly, I went all in and lost £75, (really £25)\\n\\nI then put a further £50 in, as I couldn't believe i'd lost.I created my own strategy, placing bets on outcomes that were 90% certain and which had rubbish odds, but i'd still make a decent profit. For example with my £50 i'd be making anywhere between £2-£5 profit if I went all in. obviously, £2 isn't anything by itself but i'd developed a win streak, occasionally i'd make £10 per winning bet. I built this to around £110, and on a bet which would've returned me £117 (£7 profit) I lost it all. I can't really remember how much i'd deposited after, but all I know is that I lost all my money again.\\n\\nThis is when my stupidest mistake happened, I withdrew £200 and in attempt to chase my losses I placed a bet on a match again, something like under 2.5 goals in the second half. Everything went smooth until the last 10 minutes or so when all of a sudden both teams scored in quick succession and before I knew it i'd lost £200.\\n\\nI think I must've deposited another £50 or so, and once again I built this up to around £90 before I lost it.\\n\\nI can't remember how many times this happened, all I know is that everyday I would make around £40 before blowing it all.\\n\\nI checked my bank balance on my app and realised I was down to my last £20, So I withdrew £150 I had on a trading broker to my bank account.\\n\\n(I built the 20 up to around 50£ before blowing it)\\n\\nThe next day around midday my £150 came into my bank account, and I deposited 100£ into Paddy Power to gamble again. I grew it to £140 in the first day, and in the morning after I grew it to around £170 before blowing it all midday.\\n\\nI now had around 50£ or so left in my bank account, and I deposited £10. I grew it only up to £15 before losing it all.\\n\\nSo now it's today, the 14th of June and i've deposted £30 at around 4pm. Won a couple of bets, grew it to £36, before blowing it all on Japan V Scotland who scored in literally the last 30 seconds of the game at 95 minutes. (I'd been betting on the score to be 1-1)\\n\\nI've know deposited my last £10 as of an hour ago and it is now at £11, and currently on a bet. \\n\\nI've just turned 18 in April, the money I blew is from my part time job i've had for a few months. I make anywhere from £250-500 a month, however I'd just been paid on the 9th of this month and that is the day I also started gambling. I have nothing in my bank balance, and thankfully i don't have any bills apart from phone bill which has already been paid. I usually give my mum £50 a month, I won't be able to do that this month and I know she'll wonder why. Its also fathers day this weekend and once again, I won't be able to buy anything.\\n\\nI've also currently been doing my A levels and my gambling has definitely had an impact. I've been pretty much been glued to my phone watching my bet and/or the football match if I can, meaning my revision has been impacted. Thankfully I don't think it has been majorly and I only have 2 exams left, one on Monday and the other later on this week. \\n\\nI've always been a moderately high spender and my parents have always criticised me for spending a lot of money on clothes, (£200 for a jumper, £100 t shirts etc) and now I have no clue how i'm going to explain to them i've lost £600 when they begin to wonder.\\n\\nI'm also a brown boy so saying i've been gambling is gonna be kinda....awkward.\\n\\nI wanna say i've learnt my lesson but I can't stop gambling...It's just the fact that I know I can win money easily that attracts me to it.\\n\\nI get paid on the First Friday of every month and I currently have only a £20 note to last me this month...Once again i'm grateful I have no bills or anything, but honestly what the ****. Paddy power still haven't taken my funds (their all still pending on my banking app), so my balance states £680 however my available balance states £0.80...I'm just wondering about the mental impact this is going to have on me, and if i'm going to be a problem gambler for the rest of my life? I'm, planning to move out for Uni this september, and i'm scared i'll blow my loans on betting.\", \"Hi there,\\n\\nI would like to get some opinions regarding  what you reckon would be most beneficial financially in the long run  and perhaps your personal experience with this if you feel like sharing  .

Lets begin:\\n\\n1. prolific    -This is a survey site BUT, I found that it actually pays better than other sites like this out there. Some researchers are willing to give out rewards as high as £5 for doing something that takes 20mins (that\\'s £15 per hour). I have even received bonuses that range from £0.50-£5. (I made around £200 within 6 months, ~£30 per month)\\n\\n2. gener 8 ads   -This is a really great one as you don\\'t do anything. It replaces regular adverts with their adverts which give you a % of the money made when viewing them. Essentially you are being paid to see the ads you would normally see. This does require you to give up adblocker. However, They also have a similar thing called Tabs, when you open a new tab you\\'ll be bought to a new splash screen which automatically has an advert on there. Every time you open a tab, you get paid (cool eh). (Up to this point I have made £220, I continue to make around £20 per month from browsing the web).\\n\\n3. Slice the pie   -This is a review site. You can listen to music, watch trailers, view product designs and rate them all. The website will give you like 5 questions to answer in short sentences or pick from a list. The pay isn\\'t 100% great but, its quick to do every now and again. You also get paid more, the more \"good\" reviews that you complete. (I made £100 from this within 8 months).\\n\\n4. Fiver  -If you are a uni or A-level student with a talent in music, design, writing or languages, you could make some serious cash on here. I composed some music on here for various people and charged £25-60 per composition depending on amount of instruments/complexity. Designs and art can go for £100\\'s if you are actually good!! However, you might find it difficult when starting out as buyers probably won\\'t buy from you. (I don\\'t do this anymore but managed to bag £200 in total)\\n\\nThese are only SOME ways that can make you money online however, I only wanted to share the sites that made me more than £10 in three months... If you have any other GOOD sites, drop em down below as I might check them out.', 'So I know that when you turn 18 you get access to a back account whether it has like £50 or £50,000.

Joking ahah)\\n\\nI plan to buy a car, which my family think is a good idea as it’s more practical to get to sixth form but I’m not 18 till October and I know it’s not essential but I’d quite like it for summer time if everything calms down.\\n\\nIs there anyway to get access to this early, my mum said there’s no way you can you have it wait but a few of my friends have had access to theirs which I don’t understand, ( It’s definitely not a different one)\\n\\nIf you can’t get access early when do you?

I am currently developing an alternative economic system and would love to know how you think about it.The idea was to provide an ecosystem where economic activity can happen in it, without being interfered with /regulated by the current capitalism+nation setting. A system that part of it will rely on peer-to-peer technology for censorship-resistance other crucial deliverables needed for the project, such as programmable contract and inherent currency. I am also thinking about an ID system supporting a higher level of cooperation and weighted democracy, and other performance enhancement, such as privacy protection using zero-knowledge proofs.In short, its current form is an online software (it\\'s in beta). The infrastructure of the transaction and most of the scripting was provided by a blockchain-based platform called Ethereum. Now it can: create financial services such as banks, investment services and set the rules by themselves. I have designed a visual programming language to make it easy for people that don\\'t code. The system can also generate a mechanism on demand that might provide job opportunities. Currently, I only have enough time to develop an agent-based sales system. There is also a mechanism that allows people to make derivatives and other financial instruments, but it\\'s not completely done yet.I am looking forward to discussing the idea with people that would be interested in what this system stands for, and coming up with more idea and feature to put in there.Just like how Wei Dai put it in his famous b-money essay: \"A community is defined by the cooperation of its participants, and efficient cooperation requires a medium of exchange (money) and a way to enforce contracts.\"Let me know if you are interested.', 'Hi,\\n\\nI\\'m a uni student on a placement year.

It works really well either served hot or cold, and you can swap around any green veg that you happen to have to hand.\\n\\n\\nNew Potato Salad with Shallots, Parsley and Vinaigrette - This potato salad is lovely in that it isn't heavy and creamy - instead it has a lovely light vinaigrette. You could sub the dijon mustard for any other you have (reduce the amount if it's a strong one!), white wine vinegar for apple cider vinegar or rice vinegar, and parsley for any herbs you have to hand.\\n\\n\\nHong Kong Style Lemon Iced Tea - Nothing says summer like a nice cool glass of sweet lemon iced tea! This is much easier to make than you would guess. There's no need to use the specific tea in the recipe - it works just fine with any regular tea (Tetleys, PG tips etc., the cheaper the better). You can prepare a big batch and it will keep for about a week if covered and refrigerated, although it may not last that long!\\n\\nSummer Egg Salad with Basil and Peas - This recipe is filling enough that you won't go to bed hungry, but lovely and light perfect for those mild summer evenings.

So I phone my brother to ask if he has the order number on his phone-and so I picked a tiny crumpled and folded piece of paper out of my jacket pocket and scrawled the number down like it was a public emergency situation-then returned and was granted my order-which I had to wait for whilst I piled up the salad box with all sorts of veggies like jalapenos, tomatoes, sweetcorn and cucumbers. After packing all that goodness into a small box, I went to receive my pizza order which included 4 boxes of sides, two huge pizzas and two bottles of drink. I had to carry all this delicious cargo out into the food court, down the elevator and out the back of the shopping centre without any of it tipping over-and somehow I made it out the back where a bus stop served as a suitable resting place for me to lay down all this deliciousness. Then all I had to do was wait for my taxi to turn up-the driver of whom hadn't even gotten out of bed yet-so I had to wait about half an hour whilst picking out a few veggies to nibble on whilst I wait for pick-up. When my driver arrived he parked momentarily in the bus-stop zone and had to turn his car around and wait for me on the other side of the road to where I was. Eventually I got all that food into the taxi, made it home, gave my brother his pizza, sides and drink-and then I relaxed, sat down and ate my Philly Cheesesteak Pizza.\", 'I would say about the same , one or two more snacks.', 'If I order a takeaway delivery how safe is it as the chef will have handled the food prior to packing it?\\n\\nWill heating the food till it’s  boiling hot in the microwave before eating it make it safe?', 'Following on from my question about how you take your cuppa, do you leave tea bag in or out?\\n\\nI leave mine in.\\n\\nI like my teas and coffees strong: no sugar in either, with milk just for teas, with the occasional biscuit dipping.', 'I would the average New York cheesecake in restaurants.', 'I had a dominos last night and I left some pizza out but only with a paper towel over.

I don\\'t know why but since the 5th Grade, I\\'ve always liked to wear my school\\'s sport uniform at home. I go to school early in the morning in my formal uniform and when I get home in the evening, or sometimes in the afternoon, I just tend to change into the sport uniform, not casual normal clothes. I wear it all day at home and even sleep in it (even weekends, during holiday and summer). I don\\'t know why, I just feel comfortable when wearing it. And I have more than one or two sport uniforms so I don\\'t have to worry about not having enough clothes, even if I have P.E on the next day. So basically I prefer sport uniforms as my home clothes. I only get changed into casual clothes when I go out with my friends/family, or when my family have guests at home, but still not when I go out nearby to buy something.\\n\\nThe thing is, much as I want to wear it other than at school, I don\\'t want other people to see me in it \\'cause I\\'m sure they\\'ll think I\\'m crazy, weird and they won\\'t feel comfortable seeing me wearing it (except my parents, they\\'re cool with it and usually don\\'t even notice that I\\'m wearing it). For example, when someone (a neighbour, a relative, a friend) rings the doorbell on a Sunday and I go answer the door (with my sport uniform on), it\\'s very embarrassing and there\\'ll be an awkward moment if they start to ask why I wear it on Sunday. Usually I\\'ll say I have a school trip or Sunday classes which require uniforms, if it\\'s a Sunday morning; but it\\'ll be really difficult for me to make up a story if it\\'s a Sunday night! I\\'m also stuck in the same situation when I Skype with my friends at night, or when I invite my friends over on weekends. \\n\\nI know it\\'s really weird, even I think it\\'s weird. I many times decided to stop wearing sport uniforms and start wearing casual clothes like everybody else. Of course I didn\\'t have to change clothes all the time when there were guests and could avoid all the awkward moments.

The pullover type is my favourite but I’ve got a few zip ups as well. I’ve also got a yellow Champion hoodie which I posted pics of me wearing a while back and most people liked it. \\n\\nI usually like to wear them with grey or black joggers (as I find jeans quite uncomfortable now for some reason) and black or white ankle socks (and trainers if I go outside). I find this combo really comfy to wear, at all times of year as I live up north where the summers aren’t that warm, if it’s a nice day or I’m playing football I might wear shorts and a hoodie or just wear a t-shirt. \\n\\nPlus my house is always cold (about 18-20°C) so I kind of have to wear one or I’ll freeze lol.

I spoke with a guy called Tom who asked for a £50.00 deposit for a shoot scheduled for last month (£50.00 which I won't be getting back) although I was assured if I did not purchase any photos taken on the day I would receive a refund. \\n\\nOn the day, I traveled to the 'studios' in Marylebone and arrived to not an office or a convincing studio space but what was essentially someone's refurbished flat, I immediately felt uncomfortable and like this wasn't legitimate. Models were told to sit in the living room, people were there with their families, the room was extremely cramped and dark with blasting music and a pair of women in the corner doing hair and makeup, there was nothing professional about the set up whatsoever. I was told to bring a number of outfits so I brought I suitcase which I had to dump in the hallway amongst other people's and then I grabbed my four different outfits I'd prepared for the four shoots I was expecting to do. Not one of the members of staff introduced themselves or told me the schedule of the day. Nothing was done thoroughly or professionally. The photographer told me what to do for each shoot, which was either indoors or outdoors and it was all very quick and unorganised.  \\n\\nAfter my final shoot most of the other candidates had left and I was sat waiting in the living room. A young lady entered and asked me to follow her into the 'office'. The office was more like a hole in the wall with a couple of chairs and a desk, it was extremely cramped and dark with one light, you couldn't fit three people in there. We began to look through my photos and she couldn't give me enough compliments about how natural I was at modeling etc etc. She then asked me what I wanted to get out of this pursuit which I thought was odd, I was expecting her to tell me the procedure, whether they thought I had potential and on that basis offer me work. \\n\\nI said all of this to her (that I wanted to see where I could get to as a model) and asked how she thought I had performed. She then told me that I had an incredible amount of potential and that they wanted to have me on board and to start getting the work in for me. At this moment, the Company Director Matthew was suddenly in the doorway, he introduced himself and was very kind and charming. The woman at the desk continued, telling me I would need to set up an Efolio as a visual CV for clients to look at when searching for a model. \\n\\nThere were three packages to choose from Gold, Diamond and Platinum and the difference between the three was the amount of photos and the ability to edit and modify those photos. The prices of these packages were, £2500.00, £4500.00 and £6000.00. I was told if I wanted to have any of the photos taken on the day and to start up an Efolio, I would have to choose one of these ridiculous options. This online portfolio would then get me work with top brands, according to them 'Dolce & Gabbana', 'ASOS'. Being excited by the opportunity and overwhelmed by all of the praise (strategic), I didn't realize I was being scammed initially and then I called my parents who immediately told me I was in a pressured selling situation and was being scammed MASSIVELY. \\n\\nMy father being a business owner tested the Director, asking for a copy of the contract to look at and said only on that basis would any payment be made. Matthew apologized and said he couldn't provide a copy of the contract (because it's not legitimate) and then tried to convince him that pressured selling wasn't going on. My dad said to him if my daughter is that good and you want to employ her, you will let her bring the contract home for review and come back to you but Matthew would not budge. His excuse was having to delete the photos if no contract was signed on the day they were taken for privacy reasons (********). \\n\\nOnce I realized what was going on I got out of there and avoided paying thousands of pounds for an online portfolio of photos. I was sent a Welcome pack, emails etc before my shoot to make it looks legitimate but extreme caution people, it's not. \\n\\nIf an agency or modelling channel for agencies tells you that they need to shoot a 'portfolio' or suggests a 'free shoot' but with the addition of buying prints or images IT'S A SCAM. A models book should not cost hundreds/thousands of pounds and should not be shot by only one person or in one studio in a day. \\n\\nThe TopModels website I submitted a photo on come up on every search of legitimate agencies on Google and use their names to seem reputable, do not get scammed!\", \"I have prom in 2020..anyone know where to get dresses like these as I don't want to spend too much and much prefer this style to prom so style..

Xx\", \"So I had my piercing done in November 2016. So it is about 5-6 months. I've been cleaning it every day, twice a day with a sea salt solution, I haven the been playing with it, and I haven't worn tight or high waisted clothing. However, regardless of this it doesn't seem to be healing...\\n\\nThis might be a bit TMI, but basically the top hole of my piercing looks perfect, I get a tiny crusty every few weeks but nothing much. And then there's my bottom hole - this keeps bleeding, having crusties to the point where the bottom ball gets stuck to my skin etc. I've been to see my piercer, and he said it's not infected and just to keep cleaning it the way I do - that was in January, and still nothing has helped! The skin around the bottom hole is red and slightly raised, so it really doesn't seem to be healing. What shall I do? I really don't want to have to take it out, because I love it, it's just being a bit of a pain right now..\", 'So I really want to cut my hair shorter because I’m getting really fed up with the longer part and the constant styling and having to constantly touch up my hair. So I thought I’d have it cut probably about 1/2 inches on the top, however currently the longer part covers a bald patch on the side of my head, would it still be a good idea to cut it? I’ve thought about it for a while and have had different short styles but it’s always been the bald patch (plus the fact that I’m a girl) that has stopped me from going proper short but would people notice/care, I’m nervous about judgement and looking weird. I’ll try and attach a photo.', 'Arghhh its so frustrating!', 'Quick summary at the end \\n\\n\\nI got my lobes pierced 2 years ago now but I had to take the earrings out after a few weeks as they got really badly infected (I had them done at Claire’s with a piercing gun and thought it would be ok because my then best friend had her’s done there and and they were fine). Anyway I never really bothered looking into getting them redone because there was loads of scar tissue and after doing some research, quite a few people said not to pierce through scar tissue. I did look into getting my ears pierced in a different place but my parents didn’t really want me to, I think mainly because while school never specifically said it wasn’t allowed, it was presumed that you could only have your lobes pierced (rules said one plain stud in each ear but never actually said where in your ear) but they also weren’t really a fan of the idea anyway.\\n\\n\\nAnyway the scar tissue has now gone a lot and I think there’s space to pierce round it without them being in a weird place so I was talking to my mum about doing that when it’s safe to go to a piercers. Also I’ve now just started home education so I jokingly said to my mum maybe I could have my ears pierced somewhere higher up too and she agreed and then when I asked if she was serious she said she would think about it!! \\n\\n\\nSo now if I can convince them, I need suggestions. I definitely want my lobes redone and then I really like the look of a flat piercing for one ear. While I don’t want my ears to be symmetrical, I don’t want them unbalanced so I don’t really know what to have on the other ear? I probably wouldn’t be allowed any more than two piercings on each ear including lobes and I’m not a fan of loads of piercings anyway. So basically I want my lobes done and then a flat piercing on one ear and someone on the other, so I would be really grateful for suggestions. Nothing too extreme that has two piercing points or needs rings or anything please because because I don’t want anything over the top I want it to look pretty and a bit classy and cute. I was thinking maybe just a helix piercing because there isn’t really many options, but I’m still not sure about position? like low or high? Also I’m not sure about seconds in the lobe maybe but I don’t know if there would be space because of scar tissue? Also obviously I wouldn’t have everything in one go but I would still like a bit of a plan of what I’m going for in the end.\\n\\n\\nQuick summary, I was only ever allowed my lobes pierced (which have healed up), mainly because of school rules but now I’m homeschooled so may be able to get a couple of other ear piercings as well as redoing lobes. I’m interest in a flat piercing for one ear but not sure about the other, wouldn’t be able to have too many piercings probably just lobes and one more in each ear so I need suggestions for the other ear.

On it are the prices for the photos ranging from 10-80 photos, 40 images will cost you around 800 pounds which is BLOODY EXPENSIVE, and the images aren’t even up to industry standards. All this is excluding the portfolio(also around £800) that they will say you will also have to purchase if you want to get noticed by agencies. at the bottom there is an option of a premium package including 50 images, Z -cards and a website that will cost £2000.

My dad is 51 and only about 2% of his hair is grey. My mum is 48 and she has pretty much no grey hair. Im pretty sure that any grey hairs I am seeing are as a result of stress.

Generally throughout the laat year or two there have been about 5 or 6 grey hairs on my head at any 1 time. The last couple of months as well I have been oretty stressed out as well and ive seen a few grey hairs on my head. The question I have is, if these grey hairs have been caused by stress which I think they have, then will they disappear if I can reduce the amount of stress in my life?  There have been periods in the kast two years where I have had no stress at all and I seem to remember that I couldnt see any grey hairs during these times.

However, at around 2 pm ish, I noticed that the tips of my hair were quite dry and frizzy in places.\\n\\nI don't know whether this was because it was really hot today, I hadn't had a shower since Sunday (I've had a shower tonight don't worry haha) or if it is because it was in the bun all of last night.\\n\\nDoes anyone have any clue on why it was like that and how I could make it less dry/frizzy?\", 'Anon or delete please.

They had a low heel, about 1 inch (basically the same as men business shoes I reckon).\\n\\nAfter having worn them a couple of minutes inside she even made me wearing them when we went to the Sainsbury\\'s next door (I\\'d do almost everything for her - maybe except wearing heels ). Despite them being too small (though her UK 8 almost fit my UK 9-9.5, weird), I found them quite comfortable: a thin sole, me being slightly taller than usual and soft leather around your feet and lower calves that kept them warm.\\n\\nMy gf told me that they looked good and I should wear them more often. I will not as they\\'re too small to wear them for more than a half an hour or so, but I\\'m thinking about buying a pair of boots myself. Most men boots I\\'ve seen are rather bulky, heavy and quite uncomfortable, so shall I go for a \"conservative\" pair of women\\'s boots?

I left Highschool with crap grades with 5 GCSE at grade 4(c). Then I enrolled onto a course which was a btec level 3 extended diploma in business and finnace and it was arlight.\\nI really like the finance part of the course I really like the maths part and got a good buzz when doing. Doing ledgers and vats calcuoation along with inputting data into the system, looking at data and figure and analysing graphs but this was all basic but I enjoyed it. In the second year we did management accounting which was working with equations and looking at ratios and company records etc but I didnt really enjoy it as much. As for the business side of things I found it quite boring and some aspects such as human resources and marketing were okay but didn't really enjoy it. I found the business side of things quite dragging. I also did workplacements at Barclays Bank and the NHS as a banking advisor and a librarian assistant. The librarian assitnat was very boring and I don't see myself doing that in the future. The banking adviser role was good and enjoyed getting the experience at the bank but pay of this kind of job is not great. \\n\\nThis is a little background into myself. I need urgent help as I am looking to commence further with my education. As I really liked the finance part of my college course and predicted a DDD i thought that was the way forward for me. So started to look at routes that could take me to the ACA route and qualify as an accountants ASAP. I thibk an apprenticeship route is best suited for me as I want to earn and learn and get the work experience in. Taking routes such as doing the AAT level 4 and then moving onto to proffesional qualification such as ACA/ ACCA or CIMA. Since I've applied to several apprenticeship vacancies and have been rejected I started to thibk that is accouting and this career right for me. Will I enjoy it for the rest of my life. Did I really enjoy the work at college as that was easy stuff. As the aca and aat qualification are not just about numbers, there are about ethics, principles of accounting and majority of the calculations etc will be done via the computer. I have read the icaew website and look at what modules I will be studying and look at the different levels. How do I know that i will enjoy all the topics that I will learn for example taxination and law and etc that I will have to learn when doing the course. \\n\\nThis has made me realise that is the accounting career the right choice for me. Additionally, i also started going to the gym and really like fitness and the hukan body and the science behind how the body builds muscle, nutrition etc. So a degree in sport and science is also another route for me. \\n\\n\\nI also came across business economics which found interesting as it teaches me accounting. Finance and economics which is ultimately a good industry and degree to have. \\n\\nAfter the coronavirus I do plan complete various placements in fields in biology. Engineering, sport and sciences(but dont know how in this carrer) accouting audit consultancy. But the thing is I'm a kind of a person who likes to go around and not just have to an office base work. I like to work with figures and data and analyse them. I need to figure out what I like and what skills I have and what job role is right for me.

However, most of the time it has not been my choice to 'not have friends'.\\n\\nI asked to hang around with someone once at school and they literally said they would have to ask if their friends would be 'ok' with that and then went off, and started talking about me behind my back and looking at me in a mean way as they were walking off. The problem here is that I would never have asked this if this person hadn't been so nice to me previously. This same person continued being very nice to me in class after doing this to me and I honestly don't understand anyone anymore. This has really effected me and now I have a fear of rejection which I think is going to stay with me forever. This happening just increased me feeling like someone that no one wants to hang around with. I can't even imagine myself wanting to actively wanting to join a social situation anymore.\\n\\nThis other group of people, however, said I could hang around with them though at lunch but obviously it didn't work out. On the first day this person came with an entourage of 10 people which was just too much for me to process which is kind of why I distanced myself from them other than the fact I felt unwanted there. I'm just used to small circles as well and this person had about 20 friends. Also, their friends didn't like me. One of the friends kept looking at me in a mean way like they didn't want me to be hanging around with them and this other friend seemed angry at the possibility I would be hanging around with them. I decided this was too much for me and I didnt want to have to beg to hang around with someone especially when being around such a huge group made me anxious. Then these other people in my class said 'we should be friends' and by that time I was so insecure from previous events that had happening, that I was feeling rejected overall and I just ran away from them.\\n\\nSo now I am questioning whether I am ugly. I personally hate myself in pictures but I have had atleast 10 guys throughout my lifetime be show interest towards me so I don't know where I stand with my looks. I am very insecure about them so I don't know why once this guy was nice to me in class. I dropped something on the floor and he literally came over from the other side of the class to pick it up for me and so I sit here questioning whether I am an ugly troll or if its just my personality that clashes with others. There would be other guys also trying to strike up conversation with me as well as a guy once in public trying to start a conversation with me but still even after all of this and the attention that I received by them, I am someone that has no friends.

This is a long post so I apologise in advance\\nThe issue now is that I feel like I've become TOO experienced and am now driving like an experienced driver rather than a learner and today I noticed I have picked up some bad habits. I'm gonna try and solve them but I think its gonna be quite hard \\nI had a few questions about the driving test:\\nI'm aware that you can get major faults for being too close to parked cars and this would be a clearance issue- I know its around a meter distance but we have this really nasty road where 1m is not possible in terms of clearance and there isn't really anywhere to stop on the sides if a car comes because the cars are constantly parked there so the only thing to do is either carry on really slowly or just stop on the road itself. Now if I was to just stop (not on the sides as this isn't possible) will I get a major? \\nI've noticed that I drive pretty fast now and barely ever do stuff in first gear, particularly mini roundabouts and junctions, should I get into the habit of putting into first gear? I feel like my approach speed is a lil faster than a learner would normally go for just because I've become pretty confident doing it. It's not a fast speed, its just that I don't put it into first gear because my car can handle going as low as 6mph in second gear.\\nAlso, I don't make my mirror checks that obvious and sometimes I just glance or just move my eyes to the side mirrors when exiting, do I need to make it completely obvious?\\nI also stop kind of early before the stop lights and often move forwards slightly because my juddgement is a lil off here, so I just stop early and then move if needed, I'm worried the examiner will think I'm trying to go on a red light\\nAgain, if the junction is closed, I tend to slow down a lot but I never fully stop (unless it says so or I need to). I take a quick glance left and right and just go. Is this wrong? I feel like I should maybe check twice just to make it obvious. If I was to stop and nobody was coming from either direction on a give way sign, would I get a hesitation fault? \\nMy signals are really sensitive and basically will switch off at the slightest steering movement so when it comes to parallel parking, the signal will cancel pretty quickly, do I need to keep the signals on at all times? \\nI feel like I'm rushing quite a lot whilst driving, idk like I'm being cautious but at the same time feel like I'm doing things too quickly... my mum is a little strict lol so if I miss a gap, she's always like why would you not just go so I just feel like I've picked up this bad habit of kind of rushing and trying to do things in one go. \\nLastly, I feel like I drive a little slow on roads with bends, like we have this road with some bends and its a 30mph area but I never really go above 25 just because the road has some fairly sharp bends, would this get me a minor for driving too slow? It's a little dangerous to be doing 30 as the straighter sections are just too short to bother speeding up\\nTo summarise my questions:\\nIf there is no way to avoid getting too close to parked cars, is it better to stop and let other cars get through or just drive very slowly past them?\\nIf I don't do junctions and mini roundabouts in first gear (unless needed to of course) will they give me a major fault?\\nIs not making mirror checks obvious an issue?\\nStopping like 2-3m before a red light too much distance?\\nIf signal cancels itself and I don't put it back when parallel parking, fail?\\nIs slowing into first gear necessary even when nothing is coming?\\nDriving 20-25mph in a 30 zone with bends a minor for slow driving?\", \"I got kicked out of college and I don't know how to tell my parents.

Either way, I wouldn't have any way to pay rent, as I don't have any income, and my parents are under no legal obligation to support me. I don't think the council would help me either, as at 16 I would be too old to be in care, and seeing as there is no danger at home, they would probably think I could just stay at home. However this will not be possible, as I am going to be kicked out, and it is entirely my fault, so not like my parents are being unreasonable. I know they won't change their minds and I don't expect them to. Seeing as their income is quite high, I would not be a priority for the council either, as I am not exactly low-income, and they would expect my parents to help me.

It’s horrific.\\n\\nThe fear goes to a completely new level when you realize it’s a spider in your bed. Even though spider bites are on the rise this year, it’s fine, there’s no need to panic. Don’t freak out! Because we you freak out the spider freaks out!\\n\\nTo help you through this potentially scarring situation, here are 12 simple steps to follow when you find a spider in your bed.\\n\\nStep 1 – Don’t panic\\nYou’re going to want to start screaming and yelling while throwing your blankets as far away as possible. You must fight these urges. Keep calm and realize you’re in control of this situation.\\n\\nStep 2 – Slowly get out of your bed\\nObviously you don’t want to stay in the same bed as a spider, so slowly move your legs away from the demon creature and slide out of bed. Try not to disturb the spider so it doesn’t run. This is very important.\\n\\nStep 3 – Step out of the room and quietly close your bedroom door\\nAgain, you don’t want to provoke the spider in any way because who knows what it was planning. Seriously, how long has he been watching you? Are there other spiders with him? These are questions you can’t answer, but that doesn’t mean they won’t linger in your mind. You need to create some separation.\\n\\nStep 4 – Get that suitcase you put behind the couch\\nYou remember that emergency suitcase you packed in case a situation like this occurred? It’s time to put that plan in motion. Grab your suitcase and put it in your car. It should contain enough clothes for at least 10 days as well as any toiletries you need.\\n\\nStep 5 – Collect any personal belongings that hold sentimental value to you.\\nIf you have a family photo album or certain heirlooms that are irreplaceable, gather them together as quickly as possible. You can’t get everything, but take the things that mean the most. This might mean leaving pets or roommates behind. In a moment like this, relationships are going to be severed.\\n\\nStep 6 – Soak your house in gasoline and set it on fire\\nI know this is the house your parents raised you in and left to you in their will, but will you ever really be happy in there again knowing that spiders think they have open access to your bed while you sleep? The only way to truly be purged is through fire. Burn that thing to the ground.\\n\\nStep 7 – Cover the ashes in bug spray\\nThere’s a good chance you killed the spider in the fire, but you can’t know for sure. You need to make sure the very fabric of this piece of earth is dead and barren for the remainder of time. Pour bug spray, weed killer, bleach, acid, and anything else you can find onto the ashes to make sure it is a desolate wasteland for eternity.\\n\\nStep 8 – Wait for the authorities to arrive\\nMore than likely someone saw a house burning down without knowing the context in which it was burned. It’s perfectly fine. When the police or fire department arrives, explain to them what happened in your bed. Not only will they not press charges against you, they’ll pull out their guns and start firing into the ground to help make sure the spider is dead. This is one time when excessive force is appropriate and welcomed.\\n\\nStep 9 – Leave town\\nWe’ve all seen Halloween and Friday the 13th enough to know that the monster never dies. Just when you think you’ve destroyed it, it finds a way to resurface and seek revenge. You need to leave town and cut ties with everyone you know. The spider knows who you love and knows who means the most to you. Don’t you think it’s going to hit you where it hurts? You need to vanish.\\n\\nStep 10 – Burn off your fingerprints\\nI don’t know if spiders can track you by your fingerprints, but if Will Smith’s character on Men in Black found it to be a necessary step to vanish, then so should you.\\n\\nStep 11 – Spend the rest of your life living in paranoia and fear\\nYou’re alone now. You’re like Jason Bourne. If you develop a relationship it will only be ripped away from you and you’ll feel responsible for their demise. You’ll never truly feel safe again and no matter where you go, you’ll always be looking over your shoulder waiting for that spider to return and finish the job.\\n\\nStep 12 – Call an exterminator\\nIf all the other steps seem like a bit much or if you don’t want to lose your deposit by burning down the town you’re renting, you can alternatively call an exterminator to come in and spray your home every few months. Either way, you should be safe after following these steps. (https://brobible.com/guyism/article/...bite-reaction/)\\n\\n😂', 'I was treated very disrespectfully by my lawyer.

Although I got A's in my mocks, my final grades were not good due to personal circumstances and I was too afraid/anxious to seek extenuating circumstances help at the time. Ended up going to a university which was about in the 40-50's in the league tables - not the best. This is going to sound bad but the whole cohort were not that bright and a lot were international students from places like Cyprus and Poland. I found it extremely easy to achieve a 1st in all my assignments. So I ended up getting a 1st without even really trying and decided I wanted to switch uni's if I could. I ended up getting a place at a top 10 university, except that I would have to restart from Year 1, which I was fine with.\\n\\nHere (same degree) I found the work much more difficult. I struggled but managed to get a 2.1 in my first year, which went down to a 2.2 overall. Albeit I did go through some personal circumstances which deeply affected me, the work was definitely more challenging. I had already anticipated this as I was around student's who had achieved high A Level grades to get in. I should have worked harder, but I know I could have easily got a 2.1 (or a 1st) at the other university I was in. Not to mention the grade inflation rates at some universities is ridiculous and unfair.\\n\\nSo maybe this was just my own personal karma for thinking I could do better? Although I was NEVER pretentious or rude to the students at the first university I was in, I quite liked it there actually - it felt like a close nit school. Sometimes I do feel like this is just karma for trying to go to a better university, not to mention losing a whole year of my life.\\n\\nI had planned to study graduate medicine and now I basically can't with a 2.2 without doing a masters. I've seen people with 2.1's who have come from very low ranked/ low grade requirements get into graduate medicine. Although the UKCAT/GAMSAT does provide a benchmark of sorts, I don't think there is a correlation with a high degree score (from any uni) and high scores on both of those tests. I think anyone can do well in them if you just practice enough, because I have sat them both.\\n\\nBUT I really do think graduate medical schools / universities that provide masters really do need to take account of the institution that the student has graduated from because I KNOW it is so much easier to get a 2.1 from a lower ranked university.

So she told me to get out of class with bag and return after learning all definitions, I won't let seat anyone in my class who doesn't even know basics. When I was leaving she stated even children of lower classes knew this etc. Now the thing is I actually forgot that term but not other things she asked but I am unable to speak in more people.i know that's my problem and I should improve but it isn't just fear of speaking in public but it's the result of my psychological problems. I have developed several fears from past 3 years. This humiliation depressed me a lot. Like teacher, majority of class will think I know nothing, I have no knowledge. I know I shouldn't think what others think but still it's making me sad. I cried a lot after that while telling my bestfriend everything who was absent. I have to take medicines everyday for headache(migraine), I can't handle any stress without medicine. This isn't teacher's mistake but I don't know what to do. I am trying but can't improve immediately. The problem is if I won't attend her class everyone will think I am coward and even I don't want to miss class just because of this but if I attend more then she will again do the same, will ask more questions until she gets satisfied but I won't be able to answer in front of whole class. This is making me very sad and depressing me. I solution I thought is to talk to teacher personally and tell her to test me there for her satisfaction and tell my problem so she can understand but seeing her chances of her agreeing is not more than 10%. I am in a girls college, here teachers are not like this they just come teach and go.

The same two flatmates were also private messaging me asking me for money constantly about items that had nothing to do with me (I wasn't using them), but not asking anything of the other flatmates. I kept saying no, and then just had to ignore the messages as they kept on asking. Eventually it stopped, and I just went the next fewmfew keeping my distance. The other flatmates at the time weren't being harassed at all (They weren't as close at this time as they wouldn't really talk to each other, idk why) but they did nothing to help the situation, despite being frustrated with them, but they are generally quite spineless. In the meantime, we had a cleaning rota but it got to the point where the two bad flatmates had never stuck to it, and the other spineless flatmates just got lazy and were suddenly not cleaning up after themselves and their dishes piled up immensely (as in no space to cook food at all, every space was piled high with dirty dishes and they would be their for over a week). I was following the rota week by week but it got to the point where I was at uni every week day all day and in work every weekend all day (side note, none of them actually go into uni or work, just lay around in bed) so I barely have time to cook and make any mess but found time to do my chores, I was basically just cleaning up after them and putting their rubbish out. I eventually confronted them about the cleaning one day as I'd had enough of the harassment and whatnot, and also about several kitchen items of mine going missing, but I feel as if I just got gaslit. They tried to say that I don't clean so all the dirt is my fault, despite me following the rota every week often doing multiple people's jobs, accused me of taking their kitchen items when I know what are items are mine and resorting to name-calling, commenting on my weight and trying to treat me as if I was mentally unstable (I didn't call them names or mention their appearance, I also don't have a history of mental health issues). After this I stopped cleaning altogether, only my room and my mess, avoided them and got on with uni and work. The spineless flatmates (who were not present at this confrontation) have also not spoken to me since, I'm guessing their all suddenly best friend's now as they spend more time together now. For the past several months, the kitchen has not been cleaned, there's been trash and food all over the floor, dishes piled up, stains and grease all over the worktops as well as trash left outside the flat, which has most definitely come from them as I avoided the kitchen altogether honestly, and they only recently cleaned it up due to an inspection from the landlord. Around the past few weeks the same two flatmates have again been harassing me for money, this time for cleaning products, which I said no as I have my own and I'm not cleaning their mess, pretty much accused me of not helping around the flat and that's it's not fair that I'm not contributing money, even though I barely leave my room now and don't use the kitchen and they've done the exact same thing throughout the year. The two bad flatmates also leave windows open and the front door unlocked overnight which is a security issue, despite them  complaining to everybody else to lock them. All of this also takes place through our group chat and private messaging, they never confront me. I'm basically being made out to be a horrible person and at fault for everything, this has all honestly taken a toll on me mentally  and physically, and doesn't help as I had a death in my family around the time the harassment started again so dealing with this and grieving has been a lot as the death hit me hard. I had to accept to stay on in the flat for next year due to me and some other friends being unable to view houses and find other housemates due to the coronavirus lockdown, and so I feel trapped and worried. I'm mostly worried about being made out to be a bad tenant and being complained about to the landlord, I have been taking photos and videos as evidence if I need to stand up for myself, but not sure what the landlord could do about the harassment or my wellbeing, any advice for that would be appreciated, thank you.

As well as all this screaming, there's also  slamming doors and crashing sounds from inside his room - all of which are audible from the very back of inside my flat.\\n\\n- He's also constantly smoking both cigarettes and weed - both in his room and in the communal corridor, in direct contravention of the landlord's regulations - and the fumes from both of these are crossing the corridor and coming under my door.

Sometimes you just don't feel motivated and that's okay, it's normal. For some, motivational videos on youtube can do the trick so maybe give that a try. With consistency in mind, you should put aside some time everyday to do something active. Maybe that's when you wake up, an hour or two after breakfast/lunch, or in the evening. It doesn't matter what time it is, so much as you follow through. There are a lot of home workouts on youtube, e.g. Chloe Ting, MR LONDON, POPSUGAR Fitness that you can follow along with, slow down and pause so you can go at your own pace. The important thing is DON'T GIVE UP!! Trust the process. Do not weigh yourself everyday. Remember that your weight fluctuates throughout the day so when/if you do weight yourself do it around the same time of day. Tbh I don't recommend weighing yourself often or even at all as it can become quite obsessive and your weight can even increase with gaining muscle, which is a good thing \\nIf following youtube workouts isn't your thing, even watching them to select a specific type of stretch/ exercise can be helpful because then you can curate your own fitness regimen, with exercises that you like, e.g. x10 squats followed by X5 burpees etc. \\nI'd recommend taking a photo of yourself every 2-4 weeks in the same workout gear. Because you see yourself everyday in the mirror it's hard to see any changes, however by taking a photo, you can later compare the photos over time. On the topic of comparison, never compare your fitness journey to someone else's- comparison is the thief of joy.\\nLosing weight and becoming fit is a journey, not a destination. If you're consistent for 1-2 months, it will start to become a routine. You won't see it as a chore but see it as just part of your normal daily routine, like brushing your teeth or taking a shower. \\nAnother youtube channel I'd recommend is LukeNarwhal.

Use this to your advantage.  You already know how to lose weight: you've clearly done it very successfully before.  I'd recommend that as long as it wasn't some sort of deranged dieting, you do again what you've proved to work already.  However, this time, you need to examine what is was about getting stressed that threw you off the diet in the first place, and then completely once Christmas came around.  Stresses and issues will doubtless arise again during this weight loss, and you need to sort of pre-empt them by thinking about coping strategies that don't involve turning to food, so you can live your life and not only continue to lose weight, but keep that weight off, which is the hardest part.\\n\\nYour paragraph about sugar was a bit troubling, as was the idea of 'not having any 'unhealthy food' in the house.  It's a bit 'all or nothing' thinking, which would fit in with the binge eating issue.  It's usually more helpful, and more sustainable, not to think of food in terms of 'good' and 'bad'.  All food is OK - it's just how much of it we eat, and the overall balance.  Obviously you need to restrict your energy intake if you want to lose weight, and restricting 'empty calories' like high fat, high sugar treats is the easy and most obvious place to start, but don't get into the mindset that you can't ever have chocolate or ice-cream or confectionary once in a while as a treat.

In other words, moderation is key.\", 'Well, there’s quite a lot of misinformed assumptions made in this post. I’ll go through them in the order you’ve stated.\\n\\n1. It is not true that you’ll lose all your hard work after a month off. If you’ve truly built up a solid base of muscle mass and worked hard for 3 years then taking a month off isn’t the end of the world. Yes, you’ll lose some muscle, but as much as you’re making out. Muscle memory also exists, so when you resume training again you’ll find that the muscle you lost will be put on much faster this time than when you initially put it on. I would expect about 2 months back training to get back where you were prior to the break. \\n\\n2. Saying there are “easier alternatives” is a pretty narrow minded statement. There are “easier alternatives” to doing anything in life so why don’t we all just sit and do nothing? We do it because we enjoy it. I’ve spent time as a runner, and I can tell you I love the gym infinitely more. It’s also completely untrue to say that huge amounts of money have to be spent on protein powders and memberships. Firstly, protein powders are a supplement and not a necessity. Secondly, a gym membership at a commercial gym costs about £15/month. A good pair of running shoes costs hundreds. As far as eating goes, I agree subjecting yourself to chicken breast 6 times a week sounds awful. Fortunately though, this is not the case in any way, shape or form. I can eat a lot more now that I have more muscle mass than I could before I started going to the gym. I eat ~4,000 calories a day and as long as I hit my protein target (very rarely need protein powder to do so) I can eat pretty much anything else I like, within reason. \\n\\n3. Please get it out of your head that the sole reason people go to the gym is to impress others. I’d argue most gym goers do this for themselves. I for one know that I’d still go if I never saw another human again. Also, who says you can’t sharpen mental abilities through the gym? I started training six years ago and now it’s led to a university degree and lifetime career choice. \\n\\nBased on your post I don’t believe you’ve ever properly invested your time/effort in training at the gym.

If you are doing these times with a physique of a sprinter [too heavy for long distance - sorry not meant in a derogatory manner!], I would say you could be an enviable, highly competitive 200 or 400 m runner.\\n\\nOther criteria to check would be your resting heart rate [effectively, first thing on waking in the morning, AND how long of resting it takes to return to close to that after an intensive workout].\\n\\nBe safe!\\nM', \"(Original post by Snfkin) \\n                \\n            \\n        \\n\\n…show more\\nHaha looking forward to seeing what people have to say on this as I'm exactly the same.

During aerobic respiration, our diaphragm contracts, creating a negative pressure within the chest causing the lungs to expand and draw in air. This is how we inhale air. Gaseous exchange occurs across the membrane of the lungs and oxygen is diffused into the blood. The oxygen travels via red blood cells to our heart where it is pumped to all other parts of our body and is diffussed into the respective cells, in this case, muscle cells. In the mitochondria within the cell, glucose from our ingested food undergoes Glycolysis to form Pyruvate, in the process converting 2ADP to 2ATP. The Pyruvate then undergoes the Linked reaction and Krebs cycle when a further 2 ADP is converted to 2 ATP. The products of the Krebs cycle travel down the electron transport chain to convert 32 more ADP into 32 ATP, producing a total of 36ATP which is used by the muscle cells to pump Ca(2 ) ions to carry out contractions.\\nDuring intense physical activities, the rate of intake of oxygen is unable to match the rate redox reactions at the electron transfer chain and an oxygen difficiency arises, inhibiting the rate of aerobic reaction. The body then increases the rate of anaerobic respiration and Pyruvate is converted into lactic acid instead, resulting in a net total of 2 ATP formed from the entire anaerobic respiration cycle. \\nDuring the Krebs cycle, CO2 is released as waste product which diffuses into the blood vessels and reacts with the water in plasma to form bicarbonate ions and is transported to the lungs where it is converted back into gaseous carbon dioxide and diffused across the lung membrane into the airway. As the diaphragm relaxes, a positive pressure is created in the chest, causing the lungs to compress and air is exhaled from our body.', \"You can lose weight and grow muscle at the same time!

Weight loss is dependent on a calorie deficit (500-1000kcal from your daily BMR) and those calories can come from any food you would like, but one should ideally eat a balanced diet consisting of carbs, fats, proteins etc. So if you keep a consistent calorie deficit you will lose weight. \\n\\nHaving a one off slip up is nothing to worry about. It is estimated that one needs to eat 3000 kcal extra on top of their BMR to gain a pound of fat so an extra 300 kcal is going to make negligible difference to your weight. If you find that it really psychologically affects you, I would recommend that you do some cardiovascular exercise and this will help mentally (speaking from personal experience). \\n\\nThe best advice I can give you, coming from a background of strict dieting, is to focus on your health during this stressful part of your life due to the extra amount of stress it has on your body and then worry about dieting. \\n\\nOverall message- don't worry!\\n\\nHope this helps\", 'depends what side of skinny fat you are. around what bodyfat. if you are towards 20% then cut if you are towards 12% then bulk\\n\\nas a noob you can do both really tho. build muscle and lose fat.', \"…show more\\nHey, Same here.

Here's what I've always been taught.\\n\\nWell the jump smash is one of the most difficult shots to play in-game so I'll talk about that last.\\n\\nThe 'overhead' clear refers to the opponent's clear passing into the deep court high into your backhand side. Overhead implies you have struggled but managed to successfully get around the clear. Now this is the difficult bit. You said overhead  'jump' shot and I highly doubt you should jump at all in a position like that. Position yourself behind the shuttle, non-racket foot forward and racket foot stepping in as you play it. I emphasise on putting yourself behind the shuttle because anything level with you is almost guaranteed to be a weak return.\\n\\nIf you're simply referring to a clear, ensure you're positioned correctly. You can jump for a clear, definitely, and especially if it's a fast one going deep and far into the court. Generally though you can simply sidestep/chasse for a clear as it tends to be high. Don't always feel the need to jump for a smash or clear. In that case you perform a scissor-kick, something also used in smashing/jump smashing. Without the scissor-kick you lose balance and this I believe is what you're after.\\n\\nScissor-kick mid-air during your jump smash or clear for three reasons:\\n1. Create momentum and perform a flat clear\\n2. Be in the correct position to move in for a potential drop shot\\n3. Regain balance. Without the scissor kick (or step forward, if you don't want to smash) you disregard your body weight and seeing as your racket foot hasn't moved forward you've got no momentum or power behind the shot nor balance.\\nSo scissor kick.\\n\\nWatch Viktor Axelson smashing.

They're cheap as well (though if you book online, don't go for hostels with less than 7,5/10 stars), and a lot in Southern Europe have hammocks, some have pools, etc. It's the best. \\n\\nHonestly, just do it. I had the best time of my life traveling and I genuinely think about those months almost every single day. I met so many amazing new people, I spent warm summer evenings chilling in Barcelona with my friends and some sangria, I went snorkelling in the most beautiful places, I had a fling, but I also missed busses, spent hours getting lost in a city, had food poisoning - and I wouldn't change a single thing because it was the best time of my life. \\nSo definitely do it, you'll not regret it!\", \"I went inter railing and I actually recommend going by Flixbus instead. Interrail is a lot more expensive than Flixbus - there are also some hidden costs like seat reservations. \\n\\nAlso, with Interrail you're not really as flexible, because you only have a limited number of journeys available and you kind of need to book our your entire trip beforehand. \\nI prefer Flixbus because it's cheaper, you're a lot (!!) more flexible and a lot less constricted. \\n\\nI always recommend hostels over airbnbs but if you're a group of 7, maybe getting one airbnb might even end up cheaper than booking 7 hostel beds - but you just need to calculate that I guess. \\n\\nI don't know where you're planning to go, but the standard cities are obviously Paris, Madrid, Barcelona, Prague, Berlin - just the big cities basically. I also really loved Portugal, especially the south (it's great for surfing as well, and drugs are decriminalised). If you're going to The Netherlands, don't just visit Amsterdam and leave - maybe go see Rotterdam or Leiden, because they're really pretty as well and the weed's cheaper. \\n\\nMake sure to also see the French south, like cote d'azur - loved Nice, but there are a lot of other cute small towns along the coastline, like Eze for example.\", \"Singapore is a wonderful place to visit - I've been 4 times with work and love it there.

Insane fines and violent punishments.\\n- Passively closed to foreigners.  You will be segregated from certain roles and will probably never be allowed to be a fully fledged citizen.  People are friendly when you get chatting, but it's a rather closed society.\\n- You'll notice if you pay attention the elderly are still working way past when they should be.  They don't have an option.  That's because 'retirement' and 'pensions' aren't really a thing.\\n- Low wages and long work hours are expected, house prices can be quite high.\\n\\nOther things I can think of;\\n- It's quite a small place, it's a city that's a country that's an island.  You could probably drive across it in about 2-3 hours.\\n- Given its position it's quite easy to travel to Malaysia or further afield to the likes of the Philippines or Myanmar (if feeling risky).\\n- If you've seen Crazy Rich Asians they definitely exist hah, and you'll notice quite a lot of designer stores, bars, hotels and restaurants to cater for them in the main areas.\\n\\nThat's all I got for now.

As you travel faster and faster (closer and closer to the speed of light), your mass increases. By the time you reach the speed of light, you would have gained an infinite amount of mass (which requires an infinite amount of energy). This is important as you approach the speed of light, time for you (as observed by an outside observer) appears to slow down. As you reach c, they would see time stop completely for you. Now the question is what would happen if you exceed c? Time would appear to go backwards for you (from an outside observer, whilst you yourself notice these changes happen not to you, but the observer/rest of world). But this would require at least the infinite amount of energy to even get to c, never mind exceeding it, therefore many seem backwards time travel impossible. (Sorry if I’ve worded this poorly).\\n\\nIt’s funny as most laws of physics work in both forward and backwards directions of time.\\n\\nSome theoretical particle physicists suggest some particles could travel faster than light, therefore trace backwards in time, the tachyon. They don’t have the same problem of infinite mass/energy as their masses are not the same as the objects they see around us. (Their masses are actually represented by imaginary numbers, which are interesting all on there own and are definitely a fun thing to learn about/research). They actually couldn’t travel forward in time even if they wanted to. These tachyons are all hypothetical though, there is no experimental evidence of them and may just be a byproduct of extrapolating the maths of special relativity (though physicists did think that about antimatter originally, and that has been discovered since).\\n\\nHope this helps with the question and sorry for the bad explanations/any inaccuracies.', 'Because of people coming out of lockdown then I think beaches will be packed irrespective of social distancing.\\n\\nIf you want beaches then go somewhere that isnt built up.\\n\\nhttps://secretldn.com/beaches-near-london-seaside/\\nhttps://www.cntraveller.com/gallery/...es-near-london\\nhttps://www.timeout.com/london/thing...es-near-london', 'Boating is amazing in Kerala', 'Up a mountain in Finland  Fricking freezing', '…show more\\nWhich university you going to?

The government has advised people against NON-ESSENTIAL travelling. You definitely also SHOULD NOT travel if you have symptoms of a possible coronavirus infection. This is the summary that applies to any setting:\\n\\n1. The most common symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) are recent onset of a new continuous cough and/or high temperature. If you have these symptoms, however mild, stay at home and do not leave your house for 7 days from when your symptoms started. You do not need to call NHS 111 to go into self-isolation. If your symptoms worsen during home isolation or are no better after 7 days, contact NHS 111 online. If you have no internet access, you should call NHS 111. For a medical emergency dial 999.\\n\\n2. Wash your hands more often than usual, for 20 seconds using soap and hot water, particularly after coughing, sneezing and blowing your nose, or after being in public areas where other people are doing so. Use hand sanitiser if that’s all you have access to.\\n\\n3. To reduce the spread of germs when you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue, or your sleeve (not your hands) if you don’t have a tissue, and throw the tissue away immediately. Then wash your hands or use a hand sanitising gel. The motto is 'Catch it, Bin it, Kill it'\\n\\n4. Clean and disinfect regularly touched objects and surfaces using your regular cleaning products to reduce the risk of passing the infection on to other people.\\n\\nAccording to scientists, social distancing is currently one of the best measures we can take to control the spread of the virus. I recommend reading this article by The Washington Post, https://www.washingtonpost.com/graph...ona-simulator/. \\n\\nAll these measures are not only to protect you yourself, but your loves ones and all the other vulnerable people in our society.

I\\'m a 3rd-year student studying in London and I moved from a little village where everything was pretty cheap so going to the city...you can say it kind of broke my bank account a little bit.\\n\\nBut, there are a lot of ways to save money even in London!\\n\\n1) Accommodation accommodation accommodation \\n\\n\\nRent is obviously the most daunting part of your expenses. Try to find a place/room that includes bills and don\\'t be afraid of negotiating your rent price as well. Typically, if you are renting a whole property, the landlord/lady might give you a reduction in the overall price if you rent for over a year as they don\\'t want to pay agency fees again in finding new tenants.\\n\\nIf your place does include bills...find cheap providers! That\\'s all I can say. If the house you live in can have a smart meter then add it!\\n\\n2) Grocery wise: y e l l o w  s t i c k e r s !\\n\\nLife-changing honestly, I usually shop on Sunday evenings when they want to throw stuff out and it saves me so much money! When I can\\'t find food that I want from Lidl, I usually go to the supermarkets and search for the reduced items. Keep in mind that you can freeze produce as well. \\n\\nAn app that is really useful is TooGoodToGo, a lot of the restaurants and cafes around London use this app too to reduce their food waste. Food is actually really decent because usually, it\\'s just leftovers from breakfast or lunch before they change their menu to the evening menu. Check the app more than once a day though, as it can update quite frequently.\\n\\n3) Scavenge for furniture!\\n\\nIf you are missing anything in your room or want more furniture, there are a lot of apps or websites where you can get it for free.\\n\\nSwapabee is a free online platform where you can swap items you don\\'t need for something else. As they say, \"where one man\\'s rubbish may be another man’s treasure\" haha. It\\'s a great app because there\\'s literally everything you could possibly imagine. Clothes, DVD\\'s, game consoles, furniture etc etc. Check it out, it\\'s a free app!\\n\\nhttps://swapabee.co.uk/referal/7508 \\n\\n4) Get a railcard discount on your oyster card\\n\\nIf you have a student oyster card, apply your railcard onto it and you can get a further discount when travelling. Just pop into any underground station and ask one of the operators or staff to attach your railcard discount to your oyster card  You can get up to 1/3 off during off-peak times!\\n\\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \\n\\nI\\'m sure there\\'s more but this is all I can think of from the top of my head so far, let me know if you want any more tips about living and studying in London  I will be glad to reply back to those who are coming in September\\n            \\n        \\n\\n…show more\\nThis is really good advice.\\n\\nI would add :\\n\\n1.

The only hope we really have is for the next generations by providing a fairer opportunity for African Americans as well as for other people. The best way to do this is by providing equal funding to our schools. \\n\\nNow, you may be asking, what does this have to do with the riots and killing? It\\'s simple, police officers are taught to defend themselves from \"dangerous people\", who happen to be minorities. Basically, the whole system in the US is whacked and the killing of George Floyd was what made people have enough. Because they\\'ve had peaceful protests and they\\'ve been struggling from the very beginning to be treated fairly. Why is it that it\\'s \"Black Lives Matter\" and not \"All Lives Matter\"? Because we know that all lives matter but black people in particular have had it really rough. The Native Americans also had it rough but they are at least now being compensated for their rough treatment while African Americans are still being mistreated. Why did \"Planned Parenthood\" start? To prevent African Americans from having more kids. Why did \"Gerrymandering\" happen? Because when black people were given the right to vote legally, the white supremacists were scared to lose their power so they created a system in which they manipulated voting district boundaries so that the outcome of an election would favor a certain political party. It\\'s similar to the literacy voting tests they had, it was so that black people couldn\\'t vote. The US has a long way to go and that\\'s why people are protesting and some are going as far as rioting because they don\\'t want the US to pretend that segregation was something of the past. It\\'s something that\\'s still going on but just in a different way.\\n\\n\"Black Lives Matter\" is and should be a US thing and other countries should use that movement so that they can look at what injustices are happening in their country because ALL LIVES MATTER but in the US we have a valid reason to call attention to African Americans.', \"Don't let Amelia 123 come on this thread or she'll throw you in the dungeon too \\n\\nI also like pineapple on pizza\", 'Starter - Baked beans\\n\\nMain - Baked beans\\n\\nDessert - Baked beans\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpoiler: Show \\nDrink - Baked beans', 'I wish I knew I really do 😅\\nAll my icing melts after just five minutes, even if I let it fully cool 😂😭', 'Hey Weixin !

From my experience Uni is completely different and it’s so easy to make friends as everyone is in the same position wanting to meet new people and by being completely yourself you will find your own people. So don’t feel pressured to ‘fit in’ as uni is a huge place and you’ll find that people are generally more accepting and willing to make friends! Before you start uni I would really recommend that you join group chats for your uni course and accommodation so you can meet people before you start and then that way you’ll   Recognise a few people before starting and it will be easier to make friends that way!

However, taking them out for 5 mins wont make the holes close up entirely. It may be a bit painful putting them back in but as long as you COMPLETELY clean the earring before putting it back in you'll be fine. Apart from these appointments dont touch or take out your earings at any cost. Before going in for it and taking them out, check with the practitioner (or whoever is doing the treatment) that you cant just tape them ove . So in short, 6 weeks healing time but as you'll be taking then in and out, 10 weeks until you can change the jewellery. No they wont close up but you may need to push the earring through the back of your ear.

Shampooing once every 2-3 days is probably fairly typical and a good starting point, you can then figure out for your particular hair/skin types whether you need to shampoo more often, or if it's unnecessary and you can wait longer between shampooing (if the latter you may want to rinse your hair through with water at a cooler temperature between shampooings)\", \"Emperor's new clothes\", 'Shein is good for that', 'miss selfridge maybe but that seems a bit more girly than urban outfitters..idk ive never been to urban outfitters.\\ntopshop!', 'Hey buddy, though they are known as cardigans only.

It really can mess with your self esteem, especially as people don\\'t have a specific reason to treat you badly - you haven\\'t done anything wrong yet people treat you as if you have done so.\\nAlthough for me, I wasn\\'t diagnosed until I was 18 so for a lot of my life I had no idea why consistently people everywhere I went saw me as different and treated me differently. It was only when I received my diagnosis that I finally understood. For me, my diagnosis made everything better as I knew that there was nothing wrong with me - I am not inherently flawed or a bad person etc. I was just different. Having the confirmation that I was autistic, for me, made me stop caring that people were unkind to me as I know deep down, I\\'m not doing anything wrong - I am simply existing the way that I am. \\nThe way others treat you tells you a lot about the sort person they are, and is not a reflection of who you are. \\n\\nObviously, I\\'m not neurotypical so don\\'t know, nor can I speak for others on why exactly some of them treat us this way. I would really recommend you watch Yo Samdy Sam on YouTube, she is autistic and makes many really useful and insightful videos about autism (particularly being an autistic adult). If I can remember correctly she has mentioned her suspicions on why exactly others treat us differently, linking it to the concept of the \"uncanny valley\".\\n\\nI would like to add, politely, that autism is not a mental illness! We may have comorbid mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, OCD etc. but these are not because we are autistic. Often, the two can be linked however. For example, masking (hiding your autistic traits to fit in) is extremely mentally and physically exhausting and damaging to your sense of self, so can lead to the development of mental health conditions etc.\\nI have recently been reading an excellent book written by an autistic girl herself (The Spectrum Girl\\'s Survival Guide: How to Grow Up Awesome and Autistic by Siena Castellon) which I really recommend you read! In one part of the book she explains that autism is not an \"accident\" or \"genetic mutation\", but is something which is beneficial to society and is what helped us to evolve as a species. \\nTo quote:\\n\" There is an implication that because our brain deviates from the norm, our brain is somehow faulty or inferior. What if this isn\\'t true? What if nature designed the two brains to be different for a reason? The neurotypical brain is optimally designed to facilitate socialisation. It allows neutrotypicals to interact socially and communicate with ease. It gives neurotypicals the ability to read body language, understand facial expressions and subtle fluctuations in tone of voice, understand different points of view, hidden messages, innuendo and other forms of communication. On the other hand, the autistic brain is optimally designed to focus on the physical world in much greater detail, to recognise patterns and shapes, to be logical, analytical and focused, to develop areas of expertise and to focus on understanding the world around us. Although these two brains serve different purposes, they complement each other. Neither is better or worse. The neurotypical brain is designed to facilitate the development of communities and civilisations and to collectively  coordinate human behaviour, whereas the autistic brain is designed to allow us to analyse and systemise, and to discern  details and patterns that enable human being so understand how the world around us works. This knowledge has been used to advance the development of society, some of the worlds;s most famous scientists are thought to have been autistic - scientists such as Einstein, Darwin and Newton.\"\\n\\nEssentially, there is nothing defective about us, we are just a different \"type\" of brain. We have our difficulties, but so do neurotypicals. There are things neurotypicals can do that we can and things they can\\'t do that we can. It\\'s just that since the neurotypicals are the majority, the world is \"designed\" for them, so their difficulties are eased or supported much better systematically. We are only disabled by our society which doesn\\'t effectively facilitate our needs in the best way.

Others have unrealistic ideas of what they want to do, usually medicine or dentistry, etc, and they find out that their academic abilities don't fit these demanding professions.

If you keep making the same mistakes, then understand what they are, practise them, then playing a little bit before and just keep going.
